/**
 * Raised when a seat that looked free was taken between reading the table and
 * writing to it.
 *
 * <p>Signalled by the persistence layer, from the {@code uq_player_session_seat}
 * constraint rejecting an insert, and translated into this domain exception so
 * the use case layer never sees a database-specific type.
 *
 * <p>This is an expected outcome, not a failure. Two players submitting a join at
 * the same instant both compute the same next seat; one insert wins and the other
 * arrives here, re-reads the table and takes the next seat. The alternative —
 * computing the seat in Java and trusting it — is a race that only shows up when
 * a real lobby fills, which is exactly when it matters (ADR-019).

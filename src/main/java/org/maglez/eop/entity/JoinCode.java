 * The short code a facilitator reads out so other players can join.
 *
 * <p>Eight characters of Crockford base32. The alphabet excludes {@code I},
 * {@code L} and {@code O} because they are misread as {@code 1} and {@code 0} on
 * a video call, and {@code U} so that a random string does not spell a word
 * somebody has to say out loud in a meeting (ADR-019).
 *
 * <p>Eight characters is exactly forty bits. That is not enough on its own to
 * make the join endpoint's rate limiter optional, but it is enough that the
 * limiter is no longer the only thing standing between a distributed attacker
 * and a real lobby. The code was six characters until EOP-24; see ADR-019 for
 * the attack model that moved it.
 *
 * <p>Stored and transmitted in one canonical form: upper case, with the
 * ambiguous characters already folded away. {@link #parse(String)} does that
 * folding, so a human transcribing {@code 7qk2fmv9} or {@code 7QKZFMV9} with an
 * {@code O} for a zero still reaches the right session.
 *
 * @param value the canonical eight-character code

/**
 * Raised when a score cannot be derived because the game it would be derived from contradicts itself.
 *
 * <p>Every refusal gathered here means the same thing to a caller: nothing. A play attributed to a
 * player who holds no seat, two tricks claiming one sequence number, a player seated twice — none of
 * these is something a request can be reworded to avoid, because none of them is about the request.
 * They are about stored rows that disagree with each other, and the only honest answer is that the
 * server could not complete the work.
 *
 * <p>That is why there is one exception type and not eight. RFC 9457 wants a problem type per
 * condition a client can act on, and there is exactly one such condition here, with eight proximate
 * causes. Eight types would be eight names for one response. The {@link Reason} is what keeps the
 * causes apart where keeping them apart is worth something: in a log, and in a test that wants to
 * pin which guard fired without matching the wording of a message.
 *
 * <p>The message names the identifiers involved, and from here it only ever reaches a log. The
 * boundary answers with a fixed string, because a trick or player identifier belonging to a session
 * the caller may not even be able to see is exactly the sort of internal key that should not be
 * echoed back to whoever asked (ADR-030, ADR-031).
 *
 * <p>Not everything the scoring types refuse arrives here. {@code ScoredPlay}'s seat range and
 * {@code Standing}'s bounds stay {@link IllegalArgumentException}: they guard a constructor that no
 * route can reach, they name no identifier, and a caller who trips one has made a programming error
 * rather than met a contradiction in stored data.

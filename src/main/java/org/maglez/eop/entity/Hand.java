/**
 * The cards one player holds in one session.
 *
 * <p>Immutable. Playing a card returns a new hand rather than mutating this one,
 * so a play that is rejected downstream cannot leave a card missing from a hand
 * that was never legally played from.
 *
 * <p>There is no draw pile. Every card in the deck is dealt at the start of the
 * session, so a hand only ever shrinks, and a session ends when hands empty
 * (PRD §3.3, ADR-023).
 *
 * <p>A hand deliberately does not carry a seat number. A seat belongs to the
 * {@link Player} who holds it and is the key this hand is filed under in
 * {@link Hands}; storing it a third time here would create a copy of a fact that
 * could disagree with the other two.
 *
 * <p>Pure domain: no Spring, no Jakarta, no persistence annotations.

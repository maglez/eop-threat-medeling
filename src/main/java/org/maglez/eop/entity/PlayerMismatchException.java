/**
 * Thrown when a play names a player who does not occupy the seat the play is being made from.
 *
 * <p>This is the sibling of {@link NotYourSeatException}, and like it this is impersonation rather
 * than a mistake about the rules. The seat a play is made from is derived from the requesting
 * player's credential and is never read from the request, so by the time this check runs the seat is
 * already trusted; the player identifier is the one thing left that the caller supplied. It is
 * checked against the identifier of the player who actually holds that seat's hand rather than
 * believed.
 *
 * <p>It has its own type rather than sharing {@code IllegalArgumentException} with genuine
 * programming errors for two reasons. The first is that an impersonation attempt and a malformed
 * argument deserve different answers at the boundary: one is a refusal to act on someone else's
 * behalf, the other is a bad request. Sharing a type would have meant the boundary could not tell
 * them apart without matching on message text. The second is disclosure — the message an
 * {@code IllegalArgumentException} carries becomes the problem detail a caller reads, and this
 * condition is only describable by naming two player identifiers. Carrying them as fields lets the
 * boundary report the refusal without putting either identifier in the response body.
 *
 * <p>The condition it guards is not reachable through ordinary play, because the seat determines
 * which hand is fetched and a hand carries the identifier of the player it was dealt to. It becomes
 * reachable if hands are ever filed against the wrong seats, and then this exception is the
 * difference between a loud refusal and two players silently playing each other's cards.

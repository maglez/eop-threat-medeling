/**
 * Raised when a player tries to play a card that is not in their hand.
 *
 * <p>This is the check that stops a card being played twice, and today it is
 * the only such check: it compares a request against a hand held in memory, so
 * two simultaneous requests can both pass it against the same starting hand and
 * both be accepted. It is therefore not yet a concurrency control. The second,
 * independent half — a database unique constraint on a played card, which is
 * what will actually settle two simultaneous requests under ADR-020 — arrives
 * with the {@code trick_play} table in EOP-14 Slice B. There is no such table
 * at the time of writing, and this Javadoc previously described that constraint
 * as though it already existed.
 *
 * <p>It is also the check that stops a player playing a card that was dealt to
 * somebody else, so a hand identifier is carried alongside the card.
 *
 * <p>A candidate card naming no identifier at all is reported through this
 * exception too, rather than as a null-argument programming error: a request
 * that names nothing has named no card this hand holds, and routing both
 * through one fail-closed path means the boundary answers a missing card field
 * with a client error rather than a server one.

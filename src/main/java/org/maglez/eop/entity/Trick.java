/**
 * One time around the table: each participating player lays a single card face up, and the highest
 * card of the suit that was led takes the trick unless somebody played trump.
 *
 * <p>A trick is immutable. Every rule here answers a question and returns a new instance rather than
 * mutating this one, so a rejected play leaves no trace and a resolved trick cannot be quietly
 * re-resolved.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately <em>not</em> a fixed number of plays. Because EOP-14 deals the whole deck and hands
 * off the remainder to the lowest seats (ADR-023), at 68 cards three of the four supported table
 * sizes divide unevenly — four players is the exception, at seventeen cards each — so the final trick
 * is short at three, five and six players: some seats have already run out of cards.
 * A trick is therefore one card from each seat that still held a card when it opened, which is
 * why {@link #seatToPlay(Collection)} and {@link #isComplete(Collection)} both need to be told
 * which seats still hold cards rather than counting to the table size.
 *
 * <p>Pure domain type: no Spring, no Jakarta, no persistence annotations. The persistence adapter
 * holds its own separate mapped type.

     *       can follow suit must.
     * </ol>
     *
     * <p>Note what the last branch permits: a player holding none of the led suit may play

     *
     * <p>This check is the server's, not the client's. A user interface that only offers legal cards
     * is a courtesy; the cards a client is willing to offer say nothing about the request a client is
     * able to send.
     *
     * <p>The card is resolved out of the hand before any rule is applied to it, and the resolved card
     * is what this method returns and what the caller must go on to play. This matters more than it
     * looks. A card is named in a request by identifier, and the suit and rank that arrive alongside

     * play accepted in silence. Two optional checks in front of an unguarded mutator are not defence
     * in depth, so the guard now owns the sequence and {@link #play(TrickPlay)} is package-private.

     * <p>The order is deliberate. The seat is settled first — is it a seat at all, does the play claim
     * it, and does the player named occupy it — because those three questions are answered entirely
     * from facts the requester already has, so a refusal tells them nothing they did not send. Turn

     * business learning anything about the state of their own hand from the response. Only then is the
     * card resolved out of the hand and follow-suit judged on the card as dealt rather than as claimed.

     * <p>The acting seat is a parameter in its own right, and the caller must derive it from the
     * credential the request presented. It is deliberately <em>not</em> read out of the candidate play,
     * and an earlier version of this method that did read it from there was broken. Every player is
     * told every other player's seat and identifier, because the session state has to publish them for
     * a client to draw the table, so a play describing someone else needs no guesswork. Trusting the
     * seat in the payload let a player claim the seat whose turn it was, play out of turn, and then
     * play a second card from their own hand at their real seat later in the same trick — taking the
     * trick and locking that seat's real occupant out of it, since a seat already played for cannot
     * play again. Neither trick invariant catches that: two distinct seats and two distinct cards is
     * precisely what they allow.
     *
     * <p>The hand and the seats still holding cards are likewise derived here rather than accepted,
     * both read out of {@code hands} against the acting seat. A caller that could hand in the hand
     * would be a caller that could hand in someone else's, and a caller that could hand in the seat
     * set could hand in a permissive one that made an out-of-turn play look like its turn. Passing

     * hand spans the session, so a trick must be able to ask about hands without owning them.
     *
     * <p>What remains caller-supplied on the candidate is the player identifier, and it is checked

     * not always true. At 68 cards three of the four supported table sizes divide unevenly, so a seat

/**
 * The final result of one completed game: who played, what they scored, and when it happened.
 *
 * <p>A {@code GameResult} is a snapshot taken at the moment the game ends. It is immutable and
 * carries the metadata needed to identify the game (session, facilitator, timestamps) and the
 * per-player standings derived from the score sheet at the time of completion.
 *
 * <p>The session itself is referenced only by identifier, so the result can outlive the session
 * row if the session is later swept.
 *
 * <p>The {@link Standing} list is the leaderboard in presentation order — best first, with a
 * seat-order tiebreak for stability. Positions are competition-ranked: two players on the same
 * total share a position and the next player is pushed past them. {@link Standing#tied()} makes
 * that visible without requiring the client to compare totals.
 *
 * <p>The STRIDE breakdown per player is <em>not</em> stored here. It is derived on demand from
 * the trick history by {@link org.maglez.eop.usecase.GetLeaderboardUseCase}, per ADR-030.
 *
 * <p>Pure domain type: no Spring, no Jakarta, no persistence annotations.
 *
 * @param gameResultId        stable identifier for this result record
 * @param sessionId           the session this result belongs to
 * @param facilitatorName     the facilitator's display name at the time the game ended
 * @param startedAt           when the session moved from LOBBY to IN_PROGRESS
 * @param finalisedAt         when the last trick resolved and the session moved to COMPLETED
 * @param standings           the leaderboard rows, best first

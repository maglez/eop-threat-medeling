/**
 * A game session and the players sitting at it. The aggregate root.
 *
 * <p>Immutable. Every rule that changes a session returns a new instance rather
 * than mutating this one, so a rejected change cannot leave a half-applied
 * session behind and a caller cannot be surprised by a value changing under it.
 *
 * <p>Named {@code GameSession} rather than {@code Session}, and stored in a table
 * called {@code game_session}, because "session" already means an HTTP session in
 * every conversation about this code and is a reserved identifier on some
 * database engines (PRD §5).
 *
 * <p>Pure domain: no Spring, no Jakarta, no persistence annotations. The
 * persistence adapter holds its own separate mapped types and converts.
 *
 * <p>Two numbers here are rules of the game rather than configuration. Three
 * players is the minimum because the deck's play only works with three or more,
 * and six is the maximum because the deck runs out. Neither belongs in a
 * properties file: a deployment that could set them to two and twelve would be a
 * deployment that could break the game.

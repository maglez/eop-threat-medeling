     * Deals every card in the deck, so that nothing is discarded.

     * <p>The deal is round-robin: the card at index {@code i} goes to the seat at index
     * {@code i % seats.size()}, with the seats taken in ascending order. The loop runs to the end of
     * the deck, so all {@code deckSize} cards are dealt (ADR-023 Decision 1, reinstated by EOP-92).
     *
     * <p>When the deck does not divide evenly the hands differ by at most one card, and the surplus
     * falls to the lowest seats — a consequence of the round-robin order rather than a separate rule.
     * Over the 68-card printed deck (ADR-041) that gives 23/23/22 for three players, 17 each for four,
     * 14/14/14/13/13 for five and 12/12/11/11/11/11 for six.
     *
     * <p>Dealing everything is what makes the opening-lead rule total: the lowest-ranked Tampering card
     * is in the deck, so it is in somebody's hand, so {@link #openingLeaderSeat()} always finds a
     * holder. EOP-72 briefly truncated the deck to equal hands and kept that guarantee by swapping the
     * lowest Tampering card into the kept range, but that swap always landed it on the last seat, which
     * handed the opening lead to the highest-seated player instead of leaving it to the shuffle. Dealing
     * every card removes the special case and the bias together.
     *
     * <p>An unequal deal means the last trick can be short. That is supported rather than tolerated:
     * {@link Trick#isComplete(java.util.Collection)} and {@link Trick#seatToPlay(java.util.Collection)}
     * are both told which seats still hold cards, so a trick is complete once every seat that still has
     * a card has played.
     *
     * <p>Shuffling is deliberately not done here. This method deals the deck in exactly the order it is
     * given, so a test can hand it a known order and assert the exact distribution. Randomising the
     * order is the use case's job, through an injected port.

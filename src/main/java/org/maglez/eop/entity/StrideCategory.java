/**
 * The six STRIDE threat categories. In the physical Elevation of Privilege deck

 *
 * <p>Declaration order is the order of the acronym, and that order is load
 * bearing: {@link #deckOrder()} derives from it, and the seeded
 * {@code card.suit_order} column mirrors it so the database can return the deck
 * in the order a player expects. Reordering these constants without updating the
 * seed data is a breaking change; a test asserts the two agree.
 *
 * <p>{@link #ELEVATION_OF_PRIVILEGE} is the trump suit — only a card of that
 * suit, or of the suit that was led, can take a trick.

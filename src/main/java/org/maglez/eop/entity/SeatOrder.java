/**
 * The one implementation of "the next seat clockwise", shared by every rule that needs it.
 *
 * <p>Play is clockwise, which is ascending seat order wrapping back to zero (ADR-019). Two separate
 * rules need to walk that circle and skip seats: working out whose turn it is within a trick, and
 * working out who leads the next trick when the seat that won this one has run out of cards. Both
 * used to carry their own copy of the same loop, which is how two implementations of one rule end up
 * disagreeing several stories later — and this is the rule ADR-023 exists to protect, because its
 * naive form is wrong only on the last trick, and only at the player counts whose deal is uneven
 * (68 cards divide evenly at 4 players but not at 3, 5 or 6).
 *
 * <p>The starting seat is considered <em>last</em>, not skipped. Stepping a full lap arrives back
 * where it started, so a seat that is the only one left eligible is returned rather than reported
 * absent. That is the right answer for the lead passing to a winner who is the last player holding
 * cards, and it is not a special case.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately package-private and stateless: this is an implementation detail of the entity
 * package's turn-order rules, not part of the domain's published vocabulary.

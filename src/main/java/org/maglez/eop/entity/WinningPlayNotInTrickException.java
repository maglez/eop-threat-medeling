/**
 * Raised when a trick is asked to resolve to a winning play that was not made into
 * it.
 *
 * <p>This one has no storage backstop and never will. ADR-023 measured both attacks
 * and found them accepted by the schema: {@code fk_trick_winner_play} confines the
 * winning play to the {@code trick_play} table and to nothing else, so a play from a
 * different trick, and even a play from a different session, both satisfy it. The
 * composite key that would confine it — {@code trick (id, winner_play_id)} referencing
 * {@code trick_play (trick_id, id)} — cannot be expressed, because a composite foreign
 * key with {@code ON DELETE SET NULL} nulls every referencing column including
 * {@code trick.id}, which is the primary key and not nullable. PostgreSQL 15 can null a
 * named subset; Liquibase cannot express that, and whether H2 accepts it is unmeasured.
 *
 * <p>So the check in the resolve use case is the only check that exists. That is the
 * reason this exception's Javadoc says so at length: a guard with no second line of
 * defence has to be documented as such, or the next person to read the schema will
 * assume the foreign key means more than it does.
 *
 * <p>Answered as <strong>422</strong> and deliberately not 409. A conflict invites the
 * caller to re-read and retry, and retrying cannot help here: the play named does not
 * belong to this trick and will not come to belong to it however many times the request
 * is repeated. The request is well-formed and its content is wrong, which is what 422
 * means.
 *
 * <p>A plain Java exception with no Spring imports, per ADR-005.

/**
 * The score of one game, computed from the cards that have been played.
 *
 * <p>This is the whole of the shipped scoring rule, and it is deliberately small: <strong>one point for a threat on your card, plus one
 * point for taking the trick</strong> (PRD §3.4). It must not be embellished. A richer system was tried and abandoned — four points for a
 * threat on your own card, three, two and one for the first, second and third threat on other people's, one for the trick, two for a face
 * card, three for an ace — not because it was a
 * worse game but because playtesters could not compute it at the table and looked to the facilitator at the end of every round to find out
 * who had scored. A server does not have that limitation, so a richer rule is cheap to add later and is worth recording as an option; it is
 * explicitly not part of this story.</p>
 *
 * <p>The score is <em>derived</em>, not accumulated. Every total here is a pure function of the plays and of which play took each trick, so
 * it cannot drift away from the play that produced it, and there is no running tally anywhere that could be wrong. That also means the
 * server is the only thing that ever computes a score: a client is shown totals and never asserts its own.</p>
 *
 * <p>The list of tricks may include one that is still in progress. Threat points are earned when a card is played with a threat connected
 * to it, so they count immediately; the trick point is earned by taking the trick, so it only counts once the trick has a winner. The
 * consequence is that a running score only ever grows, and that a player watching the sheet sees their threat point the moment they play
 * rather than when the trick is swept.</p>
 *
 * <p>What this class deliberately does <em>not</em> do is decide that the game has ended, or move the session to a terminal state. It
 * answers what the score is; whether the score is final is a fact about the session, which the session owns.</p>

     * An unresolved trick — the one currently on the table — contributes its plays' threat points but no trick point, because nobody has
     * taken it yet. In a real game at most one trick is unresolved at a time, but that is a property of how the game is played rather than

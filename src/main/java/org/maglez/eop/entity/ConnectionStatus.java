 * broadcast list, not a presence list: a client that closed its laptop lid is
 * only discovered on the next write to it, and the EOP-8 spike measured the
 * server reporting two live subscribers after both clients had gone away
 * (ADR-014). So this value can over-report {@link #CONNECTED}.
 *
 * <p>That makes it a display hint and never an input to a game rule. A rule that
 * skipped a disconnected player's turn would be built on a value that lies.

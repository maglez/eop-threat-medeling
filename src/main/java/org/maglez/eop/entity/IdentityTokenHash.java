/**
 * The SHA-256 digest of a player's identity token, hex encoded.
 *
 * <p>The token itself is 256 bits of {@code SecureRandom} output, handed to the
 * client once and never stored (ADR-015). Whoever holds it is that player, so
 * keeping it in the clear would be the same class of mistake as storing a
 * plaintext password.
 *
 * <p>A plain digest rather than a password KDF is the right choice here, and for
 * a specific reason: a KDF exists to make guessing a low-entropy human secret
 * expensive. The input here is not low-entropy, so there is nothing to slow down
 * — an attacker who could brute-force 256 random bits would not be inconvenienced
 * by an iteration count.
 *
 * <p>Comparison happens in Java, in memory — not as a database lookup. A
 * presented token is digested and matched against the digests already loaded on
 * the session by {@link Player#isIdentifiedBy(IdentityTokenHash)}, across at
 * most {@value GameSession#MAXIMUM_PLAYERS} players. The
 * {@code uq_player_identity_token_hash} index enforces uniqueness and is never
 * used as a lookup path. {@link #equals(Object)} therefore compares with
 * {@link MessageDigest#isEqual}, not the {@link String#equals} a record would
 * otherwise generate, which returns on the first differing byte.
 *
 * <p>That closes no known exploit. An attacker supplies a token, not a digest,
 * so steering the digest bytes to walk a comparison one position at a time would
 * take SHA-256 preimage work. The reason to be constant-time regardless is that
 * this type is the seam any future credential would reuse: a rejoin PIN or a
 * short reconnect code would carry far less entropy and would inherit whatever
 * this comparison does.
 *
 * <p>{@link #toString()} is redacted: a digest is not a credential, but log
 * output has a way of ending up in places nobody audited.
 *
 * <p>Uses {@link MessageDigest} from the JDK, not a framework hashing utility,
 * because this class lives in the domain and the domain imports nothing.

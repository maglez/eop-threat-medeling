/**
 * One player's card in one trick, together with what they said about it.
 *
 * <p>Immutable. A play is a historical fact: once made it is never edited, which
 * is what lets the trick's winner be recomputed from stored rows rather than
 * trusted from a cached result.
 *
 * <p>Carries the whole {@link Card} rather than a card identifier so that
 * deciding who took the trick needs no lookup. Cards are seeded reference data
 * that gameplay never mutates (PRD §5), so an embedded copy cannot go stale.
 *
 * <p>Carries {@code seatOrder} as well as {@code playerId}. That is a copy of a
 * fact {@link Player} also holds, accepted deliberately: a seat is assigned once
 * at join and never re-derived (ADR-019), so the two cannot drift, and a trick
 * needs the seat to work out who leads next without loading the session's
 * players.
 *
 * <p>Carries no {@link Player}. A player holds the digest of its identity token,
 * and that value has no business travelling inside gameplay data.
 *
 * @param trickPlayId  the play's identifier
 * @param playerId     the player who made the play
 * @param seatOrder    the seat that player occupies
 * @param card         the card played
 * @param threatLinked whether the player connected the threat to the system
 * @param components   the components the player named, possibly empty
 * @param notes        what the player said about the threat, or null
 * @param playedAt     when the play was made

     * Rejects a malformed play at construction, and normalises the free text.
     *
     * <p>{@code threatLinked} being false is a legal, ordinary outcome, not an
     * error: a player who cannot connect their card to the system still plays it,
     * the card still competes for the trick, and the play simply scores nothing
     * (PRD §3.3). Modelling that as a failure or as a skipped turn would change
     * the rules of the game.
     *
     * <p>Components are not required even when the threat was linked. No rule
     * says they must be, and a facilitation tool that refuses a play in a live
     * session because a text box is empty gets in the way of the conversation it
     * exists to support. Scoring (EOP-15) decides what it does with a linked
     * threat that names nothing.
     *
     * <p>Both free-text fields are bounded in length and count because they cross
     * a system boundary from a client and are written to the database.
     *
     * <p>Both are also rejected outright if they contain a control character or a
     * bidirectional formatting character. Three separate reasons, none of which is
     * cosmetic. A NUL byte cannot be stored in a PostgreSQL {@code text} column at
     * all, so accepting one here turns into an aborted transaction mid-trick that
     * only shows up outside the H2 test database. A carriage return or newline in
     * text that reaches a log lets a player forge log lines at a severity of their
     * choosing (CWE-117). And a bidirectional override lets a player display a
     * component name to the rest of the table that reads differently from the one
     * that was stored, in the one field the exercise asks people to trust each
     * other's words in. None of the three has a legitimate use in a component name
     * or a one-line note, so the boundary refuses them rather than escaping them.
     *
     * <p>The bounds count {@code char} values, so they are a character budget and
     * not a byte budget: 200 astral characters are 400 UTF-8 bytes. Any column
     * sized from these constants has to allow for that.
     *
     * @throws NullPointerException     if a required component is null
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the seat is out of range, or the text is
     *                                  over-long or contains a rejected character

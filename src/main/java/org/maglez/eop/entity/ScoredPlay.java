/**
 * One row of the official Elevation of Privilege Score Card: a card that has been played, who played it, what it was connected to, and
 * what it scored.
 *
 * <p>The Score Card shipped with the game (<em>docs/EoP_Microsoft_Docs/EoP_Score Card.pdf</em>) has five columns — Name, Points, Card,
 * Component(s) and Notes on Threat — and this record carries all five, which is the whole reason it exists as a type rather than as a
 * pair of integers. A client that renders these rows in play order reproduces the paper sheet a facilitator would otherwise fill in by
 * hand (PRD §3.4). Component(s) is plural in the original and plural here: one card's threat may name several parts of the system.</p>
 *
 * <p>The shipped scoring rule is deliberately small and is <strong>not</strong> to be embellished: one point for a threat on your card,
 * plus one point for taking the trick. Those are the two booleans below, kept separate rather than pre-summed so that a reader of the
 * sheet can see <em>why</em> a row scored what it did. {@link #points()} adds them, and a row can therefore score zero, one or two.</p>
 *
 * <p>A play with no threat linked to it scores nothing for the threat, and that is an ordinary outcome rather than an error: a player who
 * cannot connect their card to the system still plays it, the card still competes for the trick, and it may still win one (PRD §3.3). So
 * {@code threatPoint} false with {@code trickPoint} true is a perfectly normal row. A linked threat that names no component still scores:
 * the rule keys on the threat being connected, not on the naming, and the application holds no model of the system against which a
 * component name could be checked in any case.</p>
 *
 * <p>Nothing here reveals a card a player still holds. Every row describes a card already on the table, which is public knowledge at the
 * moment it is played, so no redaction is called for beyond the display name being carried for display only — {@link DisplayName} is free
 * text and not unique, so it must never be used as a key. Key on {@code playerId} or {@code seatOrder}.</p>
 *
 * @param playerId    identifier of the player who made the play
 * @param seatOrder   seat the play was made from, zero-based
 * @param displayName the player's chosen name, for display only
 * @param card        the card that was played
 * @param components  parts of the system the threat was connected to, possibly empty
 * @param notes       the player's note about the threat, which becomes the Score Card's "Notes on Threat" column
 * @param threatPoint whether this play earned the point for connecting a threat
 * @param trickPoint  whether this play took the trick

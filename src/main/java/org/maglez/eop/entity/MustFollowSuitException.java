/**
 * Raised when a player who holds the led suit tries to play a different suit.

 * <p>Following suit is the rule that makes the game a trick-taking game rather
 * than a free-for-all: it is why holding a high card of the led suit is worth
 * something, and why trumping is a decision rather than a reflex.
 *
 * <p>The check belongs on the server, against the player's actual hand. A user
 * interface that merely greys out the illegal cards is a courtesy, not a
 * control: the cards a client is willing to offer say nothing about the request
 * a client is able to send.

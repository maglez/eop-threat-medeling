 * Registers cross-cutting observability infrastructure for the application (EOP-117).
 *
 * <p>Currently this class registers a single bean: the {@link CorrelationIdFilter}, which
 * populates the SLF4J MDC with a per-request correlation ID so that every log line emitted
 * during a request is traceable. The filter is placed at
 * {@link Ordered#HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE} so the MDC key is available to every other filter,
 * interceptor and controller in the chain.
 *
 * <p>This class lives in the configuration package rather than beside the filter because
 * wiring is configuration's job; the filter itself is an interface adapter and knows nothing
 * about its registration order or URL mapping.

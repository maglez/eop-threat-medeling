/**
 * Draws join codes from a cryptographically secure source.
 *
 * <p>Eight characters from a thirty-two symbol alphabet is a keyspace of about
 * 1.1 trillion, or exactly forty bits. Read that number against a distributed
 * attacker rather than a single one: the join limiter allows ten failures per
 * minute per client address, so the useful figure is not how long one host needs
 * but how long a pool of hosts needs. The code was six characters until EOP-24,
 * and at thirty bits roughly a thousand proxied addresses expected to find one of
 * a few dozen live lobbies within days. Forty bits multiplies that by 1024
 * (ADR-019).
 *
 * <p>The per-code half of the limiter does not help against that search, which is
 * worth stating because its name suggests otherwise: enumeration never guesses the
 * same code twice, so every attempt lands in its own fresh bucket and the per-code
 * budget is never spent. Length is what bounds enumeration; the limiter bounds the
 * rate at which a single address may work.
 *
 * <p>{@link SecureRandom} rather than {@link java.util.Random} for the obvious
 * reason and one less obvious one: an attacker who could predict the sequence would
 * not need to guess at all, and the rate limiter would never see a failed attempt
 * to count.
 *
 * <p>Codes are drawn blind. Uniqueness is enforced by
 * {@code uq_game_session_join_code} and a collision comes back as a rejected
 * insert, because checking whether a code is free before using it is a
 * check-then-act race that two simultaneous facilitators would lose together.

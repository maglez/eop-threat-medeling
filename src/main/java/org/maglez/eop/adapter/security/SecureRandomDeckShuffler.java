 * composition is public. Every player can read the whole card list from the deck
 * endpoint, so the only thing hidden about a deal is the order it came out in. A
 * predictable order — and {@code java.util.Random} is predictable from a few
 * dozen observed outputs, seeded or not — would let a player who has seen their
 * own hand work out everyone else's, which is most of the information the game
 * withholds on purpose.
 *
 * <p>{@link Collections#shuffle(List, java.util.Random)} rather than a
 * hand-written loop: it is a correct Fisher-Yates and takes the random source as
 * a parameter, so the only decision left here is which source to pass. Writing
 * the swap loop by hand would add a well-known off-by-one bias for no benefit.
 *
 * <p>The list handed in is copied before shuffling, never sorted in place. The
 * deck arrives from {@code CardRepository.findWholeDeck}, which is free to return
 * an immutable or shared list, and mutating it would either throw or quietly
 * poison the next deal.

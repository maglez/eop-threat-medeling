/**
 * Issues the opaque credential that distinguishes one player from another.
 *
 * <p>Thirty-two random bytes, so two hundred and fifty-six bits, encoded base64url
 * without padding. The width is not decoration. Because the value is drawn from
 * {@link SecureRandom} and never chosen by a person, a plain SHA-256 digest is the
 * correct way to store it: there is no dictionary to attack and nothing for a key
 * derivation function's work factor to defend against (ADR-015).
 *
 * <p>base64url rather than plain base64 so the value survives being placed in a URL
 * unescaped. It never is placed in one — the credential travels in a request header
 * and is never accepted as a query parameter — but a credential that cannot be
 * mangled by transport is one fewer thing to get right later.
 *
 * <p>The returned value is handed to its owner exactly once, in the response to the
 * request that created it. This application keeps only its digest, so a value lost
 * by the client cannot be recovered, only replaced by rejoining as a new player.

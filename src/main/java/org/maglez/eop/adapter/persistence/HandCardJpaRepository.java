/**
 * Spring Data access to the cards sitting in hands.
 *
 * <p>Package private, and not the application's port. Cards are read for every hand in
 * a session in one query rather than one query per hand, because the caller needs all of
 * them before it can reconstitute anything and a query per seat would make the cost of
 * reading a table grow with the number of players at it.
 *
 * <p>Removing a card is expressed as a conditional delete that reports how many rows it
 * changed, not as a derived {@code deleteByHandIdAndCardId}. A derived delete loads the
 * row and then deletes it, which is a read followed by a write with a window in between;
 * a single {@code DELETE} guarded by both key columns closes the window and answers the
 * only question the caller has. Zero rows changed is not a failure of the statement — it
 * is the answer that the hand did not hold the card, and the adapter turns it into a
 * domain exception. That is the same protocol the session repository uses for its status
 * transitions, and it is what makes the delete the storage backstop for playing a card
 * you do not hold.

/**
 * The {@code hand_card} row: one card sitting in one hand.
 *
 * <p>The table has no surrogate key. Its primary key is {@code (hand_id, card_id)},
 * which changeset {@code 004} chose deliberately — the pair <em>is</em> the
 * identity, and it is also what stops the same card appearing twice in one hand
 * without any application check. Inventing a UUID for these rows would have added a
 * column that identifies nothing (ADR-018, as narrowed 2026-08-12).
 *
 * <p>So the mapping needs a composite identifier, and it uses {@link IdClass} rather
 * than {@code @EmbeddedId}. Both express the same key; the difference is what the
 * rest of the adapter has to write. With {@code @IdClass} the two columns stay
 * ordinary fields on the entity, so a derived query reads
 * {@code deleteByHandIdAndCardId}. With {@code @EmbeddedId} the same query is
 * {@code deleteByIdHandIdAndIdCardId}, and every JPQL predicate gains a hop through
 * the embedded object. The key class exists only to satisfy JPA and is never handed
 * to a caller.
 *
 * <p>Neither column is an association. A played card is removed with one delete
 * keyed on the pair, which is exactly the statement {@code pk_hand_card} indexes,
 * and {@link HandJpaEntity} deliberately holds no collection of these rows for the
 * reason recorded there.
 *
 * <p>{@code card_id} points into the seeded catalogue, and changeset {@code 004}
 * gives {@code fk_hand_card_card} no {@code onDelete} precisely so that a card
 * sitting in someone's hand cannot be deleted. Nothing in this class should be read
 * as owning a card: it owns the fact that a card is in a hand.

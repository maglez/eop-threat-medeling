/**
 * The {@code trick} row.
 *
 * <p>Separate from the domain {@link Trick} for the usual reason: the domain type is
 * immutable and framework-free, and JPA needs a mutable class with a no-argument
 * constructor.
 *
 * <p>No {@code @OneToMany} to {@link TrickPlayJpaEntity}, following
 * {@link GameSessionJpaEntity} and {@link HandJpaEntity}. A play is appended with an
 * explicit insert inside a conditional write, and a collection mapping would put
 * Hibernate's dirty-check between the caller and that insert — which is the one
 * place in this story where the statement issued has to be exactly the statement it
 * looks like, because the row lock taken before it is the concurrency guard
 * (ADR-020).
 *
 * <p>{@code leaderSeat} is this trick's historical record of who led it and never
 * changes once written. It is deliberately not the same thing as
 * {@code game_session.current_leader_seat}, which is the live pointer the
 * compare-and-set write path reads and advances. Changeset {@code 004} states the
 * distinction from the schema side; this class keeps it by marking the column
 * {@code updatable = false}.
 *
 * <p>{@code winnerPlayId} is nullable, and its nullness <em>is</em> the
 * resolved-or-not flag: {@link Trick#reconstitute} documents the argument as "the
 * stored winning play, or null if the trick is not yet resolved". There is no
 * {@code resolved_at} column because {@link Trick} has no timestamp field, and under
 * {@code ddl-auto=validate} an unmapped column would pass startup silently and then
 * sit permanently null.
 *
 * <p>What the column does not guarantee, stated because the foreign key behind it
 * reads like more than it is: {@code fk_trick_winner_play} proves the winner is
 * <em>some</em> play, not a play of <em>this</em> trick. Both holes were measured on
 * the deployed schema, and ADR-023's third Slice C obligation puts the check in the
 * resolve-trick use case, which will be the only check that exists.

/**
 * The {@code hand} row: one seat's holding in one session.
 *
 * <p>Separate from the domain {@link Hand} for the reason every entity in this
 * package is separate from its aggregate: the domain type is immutable and
 * framework-free, while JPA requires a mutable class with a no-argument
 * constructor and its own annotations.
 *
 * <p>No {@code @OneToMany} to {@link HandCardJpaEntity}, following
 * {@link GameSessionJpaEntity}. Cards are read with an explicit query and a played
 * card is removed with an explicit delete, so no cascade and no
 * collection-dirty-checking decides when a card leaves a hand. That matters more
 * here than it does for seats: a play removes exactly one row, and an
 * orphan-removal mapping would make the write path a diff of two collections
 * instead of the single statement it should be.
 *
 * <p>The session and the player are held as plain {@code UUID} columns rather than
 * associations, again as {@link PlayerJpaEntity} does. Every read starts from the
 * session, so nothing needs to navigate the other way.
 *
 * <p>This entity carries {@code seatOrder}, which the domain {@link Hand} does not.
 * A hand knows its own identifier, its player and its cards; the seat that holds it
 * belongs to {@link Hands}, which keys hands by seat. So the column is read back
 * through {@link #getSeatOrder()} and used by the adapter to build the map
 * {@link Hands#reconstitute} expects, rather than being pushed into {@code Hand}
 * where it would be a second authority on a fact {@code Hands} already owns.
 *
 * <p>There are no timestamps, because {@code Hand} has no timestamp fields.
 * Changeset {@code 004} records the same decision from the schema side: a NOT NULL
 * timestamp here would have been an insert failure waiting for the first write
 * path.

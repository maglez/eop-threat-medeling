/**
 * Issues version 7 UUIDs for rows this application inserts at runtime.
 *
 * <p>Delegates to Hibernate's own implementation rather than assembling the bits
 * here. The interesting part of RFC 9562 §6.2 is not the timestamp, which is easy,
 * but the sub-millisecond counter that keeps two identifiers drawn in the same
 * millisecond in the order they were drawn. A hand-rolled version that omits it
 * still produces valid identifiers, which is precisely why the omission would go
 * unnoticed (ADR-018).
 *
 * <p>Generation is application-side because it cannot be database-side: PostgreSQL
 * grew a native {@code uuidv7()} in version 18 and the deployed image is 17, H2 has
 * no equivalent at all, and tests run on H2 while production runs on PostgreSQL. A
 * column default would therefore have to be written twice and verified once.

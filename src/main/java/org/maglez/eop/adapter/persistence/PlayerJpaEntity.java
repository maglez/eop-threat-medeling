 * seat to its session — every read starts from the session — and a plain column
 * means seating a player is one insert with no proxy, no lazy load and no
 * bidirectional collection to keep in step.
 *
 * <p>The column is {@code player_role} rather than {@code role}, for the same
 * reason the card table has {@code card_rank}: the shorter word is reserved or
 * near-reserved on enough engines that the migration is not worth the argument.

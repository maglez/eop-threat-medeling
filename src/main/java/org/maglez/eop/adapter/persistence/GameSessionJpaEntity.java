/**
 * The {@code game_session} row.
 *
 * <p>Separate from the domain {@link GameSession} for the same reason
 * {@link CardJpaEntity} is separate from a card: the domain type is immutable and
 * framework-free, while JPA requires a mutable class with a no-argument
 * constructor and its own annotations.
 *
 * <p>This entity deliberately does <em>not</em> declare a {@code @OneToMany} to the
 * players. Seats are read with an explicit ordered query and written with explicit
 * inserts, so no cascade, no orphan removal and no collection-dirty-checking
 * decides when a player row appears or disappears. At six players per table the
 * extra query costs nothing, and in exchange the write path is exactly the
 * statements it looks like.
 *
 * <p>Timestamps are {@link OffsetDateTime} here and {@link Instant} in the domain.
 * The columns are {@code TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE}, and an offset-carrying Java
 * type is the mapping Hibernate validates without argument on both H2 and
 * PostgreSQL. The conversion is confined to this class.

     * The seat leading the current trick, or {@code null} before any cards are
     * dealt.
     *
     * <p>Mapped here and nowhere else. The domain {@link GameSession} has no leader
     * field and must not gain one: the current leader is a fact about the trick in
     * progress, and {@code Trick} already derives whose turn it is from its own
     * plays. A copy on the aggregate would be a second authority on a fact the
     * trick owns, which is the objection ADR-023 raises against storing a player id
     * beside a seat.
     *
     * <p>So why store it at all? Because it is the compare-and-set witness. The
     * conditional {@code UPDATE} that guards a deal, a play or a resolution names
     * the leader seat the caller's snapshot showed, and zero rows affected means the
     * snapshot is stale. As with {@code touchWhileInStatus}, the serialisation rests
     * on the row lock that update takes and holds — taken on {@code game_session}
     * before any {@code hand} or {@code trick_play} row is touched, which is both
     * the concurrency guard and the lock order ADR-023 requires.
     *
     * <p>It advances once per trick, not once per play. A play reads it and locks the
     * row without changing it; a deal writes the opening leader; a resolution writes
     * the next one.
     *
     * <p>{@link Integer} rather than {@code int} because the column is nullable, and
     * null is meaningful: it is how "no cards dealt yet" is stored, which is what
     * makes the deal-once guard expressible as {@code current_leader_seat IS NULL}.
     * The range is bounded in the database by
     * {@code chk_game_session_current_leader_seat}.

     * Serialisation actually rests on the row lock that

     * the end of the transaction, together with the unique constraints. ADR-020

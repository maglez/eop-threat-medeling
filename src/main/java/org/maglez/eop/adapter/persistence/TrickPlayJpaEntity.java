/**
 * The {@code trick_play} row: one card played into one trick.
 *
 * <p>Separate from the domain {@link TrickPlay} for the usual reason, with one extra
 * force behind it here: {@code TrickPlay} holds a whole {@link Card}, while the row
 * holds only {@code card_id}. The card is seeded reference data, so storing it by
 * identifier and resolving it on read is what makes {@link Card} single-sourced —
 * and it is also the security property behind ADR-023's first obligation, since a
 * play cannot carry a suit or rank the catalogue does not agree with.
 *
 * <p>{@code seat_order} is stored alongside {@code player_id} even though
 * {@code player} already relates the two. That is not redundancy left in by
 * accident: {@code fk_trick_play_player_seat} binds the pair to
 * {@code player (id, seat_order)}, so the two columns cannot disagree, and the
 * composite key is what makes a forged seat unwritable rather than merely unusual.
 * The backstop is measured — {@code TrickPlayForeignKeyTest} asserts SQLSTATE
 * {@code 23506} — and if it ever fires it means a use-case check was missed, which
 * is why the adapter logs that translation at WARN.
 *
 * <p>{@code threat_linked} being false is an ordinary legal outcome, not an error: a
 * player who cannot connect their card to the system still plays it, the card still
 * competes for the trick, and the play simply scores nothing (PRD §3.3). Nothing in
 * this mapping treats false as a missing value.
 *
 * <p>No {@code @ElementCollection} for the components. They are their own table with
 * their own ordinal, mapped by {@link TrickPlayComponentJpaEntity} and written with
 * explicit inserts, for the same reason no other collection in this package is
 * mapped as one.
 *
 * <p>{@code playedAt} is {@link OffsetDateTime} here and {@link Instant} in the
 * domain, exactly as {@link GameSessionJpaEntity} does it: the column is
 * {@code TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE} and an offset-carrying Java type is what
 * Hibernate validates without argument on both H2 and PostgreSQL. The conversion is
 * confined to this class.

/**
 * Stores and rebuilds the hands and tricks of a session.
 *
 * <p>This class implements both trick-play ports. That is deliberate rather than
 * economy: playing a card removes a row from {@code hand_card} and inserts rows into
 * {@code trick_play} and {@code trick_play_component}, and those writes have to
 * succeed or fail together. Splitting them across two adapters would hand that
 * atomicity to somebody else, and the obvious decomposition gives two transactions,
 * which can leave a card gone from a hand with no play recorded.
 *
 * <p>An earlier version of this paragraph went further and claimed the only other
 * option was a transaction declared in the use case layer, on the wrong side of the
 * dependency rule. That was false and is retracted. A transactional method in the
 * outer ring composes two adapters perfectly well through Spring's default
 * {@code REQUIRED} propagation, because a method already annotated joins an enclosing
 * transaction rather than starting its own, and nothing about that arrangement puts a
 * framework import inside {@code usecase}. ADR-024 carries the mechanism and the
 * retraction. Naming an option that exists as an option that does not is how an
 * argument avoids being made.
 *
 * <p>What survives is ownership, not impossibility. The transaction is a detail of the
 * persistence mechanism, so the ring that owns the mechanism owns its atomic unit, and
 * composing these two writes further out would move an invariant into every caller
 * that has to remember it.
 *
 * <p>Two responsibilities live here and nowhere else. The first is the transaction
 * boundary, for the reason above. The second is translating a constraint violation
 * into a domain exception: Spring Data types and JPA entities stop at this class, and
 * what continues inwards is a domain exception the web layer already knows how to
 * answer. {@link DataIntegrityViolationException} is the exception to that, which an
 * earlier version of this paragraph wrongly denied by saying it stops here too.
 *
 * <p>The translation is three-way, not two-way, and the two-way version of this
 * sentence was wrong in both of its previous forms. Five of the seven constraint names
 * this class knows are translated into a domain exception. Two — {@code
 * fk_hand_player_seat} and {@code fk_trick_play_player_seat}, both marked {@code
 * Backstop only} where they are declared — are recognised by name and deliberately
 * <em>not</em> translated: they go to {@code backstopFired}, which logs the name at
 * {@code WARN} and hands the violation back to be rethrown as a 500, because
 * {@code assertSeated} passed on the same facts moments earlier and a caller who did
 * nothing wrong should not be told they did. Anything whose name this class does not
 * know is rethrown unlogged, so a constraint added later fails loudly rather than being
 * answered as whichever domain exception happened to be tested first — that is argued on
 * {@code mentions}, where it happens, and not on {@code backstopFired}, which an earlier
 * version of this paragraph cited instead.
 *
 * <p>Every write begins with a conditional update on {@code game_session}. That is
 * two things at once. It is the compare-and-set that ADR-020 makes the concurrency
 * protocol, so a request carrying a stale view of the leader seat changes no rows and
 * is refused rather than applied. And it takes the row lock on the session before any
 * hand or trick row is touched, which is the lock order ADR-023 fixes and therefore
 * what makes two simultaneous requests serialise rather than deadlock.
 *
 * <p>It is emphatically <em>not</em> an authorisation check, and this class does not
 * perform one on the caller's behalf. None of the conditional statements takes a
 * player identifier, so none of them can refuse a caller on the grounds of who they
 * are; they refuse on the grounds of what the session's state is. Two of the four
 * writes, {@link #recordDeal} and {@link #appendPlay}, additionally assert that the
 * player a row names is seated at the seat that row claims — but that is a check on
 * the <em>row</em>, not on the requester, and it is the only membership check in the
 * class. {@link #openTrick} and {@link #recordResolution} make none. Neither do any
 * of the three reads, and there they are not merely absent but impossible: the ports
 * carry no acting-player parameter for a read to check against.
 *
 * <p>Establishing that the requester belongs in this session is therefore the use
 * case's obligation, and it has to be discharged before any method on either port is
 * called. Undischarged, the failure paths are an oracle: a caller who has done no
 * more than guess a session identifier learns from {@link #sessionMoved(UUID,
 * Integer)} that the session exists, what status it is in, whether hands have been
 * dealt, and which seat currently leads. Every one of those is the right answer to
 * give a member and the wrong answer to give a stranger, and only the layer above can
 * tell the two apart.
 *
 * <p>Zero rows changed is never treated as success and never rethrown as a server
 * fault. It means the world moved underneath the request. For the four session
 * compare-and-sets {@link #sessionMoved(UUID, Integer)} spends one extra read on the
 * already-failing path to say which way it moved; for the winner update in {@link
 * #recordResolution} no read is spent, because both things zero can mean there — the
 * trick is already resolved, or the trick row is gone — are answered the same way, by
 * {@link TrickAlreadyResolvedException} and so a 409. Conflating them is deliberate and
 * is only safe while nothing deletes a single trick row; the only delete in this class
 * is of a {@code hand_card}. If a later slice adds one, this is the paragraph to revisit,
 * because the second meaning would then need a 404 of its own. That case was an
 * {@code IllegalStateException}, and so a 500, until a security review of this slice
 * noticed it contradicted this paragraph.

     *
     * <p>All six answers are refusals a caller can earn, including the one that says no
     * hands have been dealt. It is tempting to read that branch as unreachable — the leader
     * seat is only ever read from {@link #findCurrentLeaderSeat(UUID)}, which answers empty

     * session — but a caller does not have to have read anything to send a seat, and asking
     * to open the first trick before dealing is an ordinary mistake rather than a broken
     * invariant. It answers {@link HandNotDealtException} and a 409.
     *
     * <p>That branch previously answered {@link SessionNotJoinableException} carrying
     * {@code IN_PROGRESS}, which told the caller a session was not joinable while handing
     * them the status that says it is; @architecture-guardian found it in the EOP-14 Slice

     * vocabulary gap rather than a policy error: {@link HandAlreadyDealtException} named one
     * state of {@code current_leader_seat} and nothing named the other, so the other had to
     * borrow a type that could not describe it.
     *
     * <p>EOP-14 Slice E split that branch in two for the same reason. A null leader seat now
     * means either that no hand has been dealt or that a hand has been dealt and played out,
     * and only the hand rows tell them apart, so one more read buys
     * {@link HandCompleteException} for the second. Nothing reaches it today: for the last
     * trick to have been resolvable every seat that still held a card had already played, so
     * no play can be in flight behind it. It is here because the alternative is a branch that
     * tells a caller its cards have not been dealt when they were dealt and finished, and an
     * unreachable branch answering a lie is worth less than an unreachable branch answering
     * the truth. Should the deal-once gate ever be reopened, this is the branch that already
     * knows the difference.

/**
 * Spring Data access to the trick table.

 * <p>Package private, and not the application's port. There is one read, and it asks for
 * the highest-numbered trick in a session rather than for an unresolved one. Whether a
 * trick is finished is a question the trick answers about itself once it has been
 * reconstituted, and a query that filtered on {@code winner_play_id IS NULL} would be a
 * second authority on the same fact — one that would silently disagree the moment the
 * domain's idea of complete changed.
 *
 * <p>Recording a winner is a conditional update rather than a save, for the same reason
 * the session's status transitions are. Writing the winner only where none is recorded
 * yet makes a second resolution of the same trick change no rows instead of overwriting
 * the first, and the row count is the whole protocol.

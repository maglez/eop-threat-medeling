/**
 * Spring Data access to the components named on a play.
 *
 * <p>Package private, and not the application's port. Components are read for every play
 * in a trick at once, because reading them one play at a time would make the cost of
 * reading a trick grow with the number of players in it for no benefit — the caller needs
 * all of them before it can reconstitute any play.
 *
 * <p>The ordering is explicit and load-bearing. A play's components are a list, not a set:
 * the same component may be named twice, deliberately, so the schema leaves component
 * names non-unique and makes {@code ordinal} part of the primary key. The ordinal is the
 * only thing that makes the list a list, so it is the only thing worth ordering by, and the
 * secondary ordering on the play identifier exists so that grouping the result is a single
 * pass rather than a sort the caller has to redo.

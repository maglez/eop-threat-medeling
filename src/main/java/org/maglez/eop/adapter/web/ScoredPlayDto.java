/**
 * One row of the Score Card, as it goes over the wire.
 *
 * <p>The two reasons a row can score are published separately rather than pre-summed, so that a
 * reader can see why it scored and not only that it did. {@code points} is their sum and never
 * anything else.
 *
 * <p>A display name travels as the plain string it is. It is neither verified nor unique, so it is
 * here for display and {@code playerId} is what identifies the player. It is escaped on the way out
 * by the serialiser rather than on the way in, so a name containing an ampersand is stored as typed
 * (ADR-015).
 *
 * <p>{@code notes} is absent when the player wrote nothing, never an empty string.
 *
 * @param playerId    the player who made the play
 * @param seatOrder   the seat the play was made from
 * @param displayName the name the player chose, for display only
 * @param card        the card that was played, already face up on the table
 * @param components  the parts of the system the player named, in the order they gave them
 * @param notes       what the player typed about the threat, or {@code null} if nothing
 * @param threatPoint whether the play scored for connecting a threat to the system
 * @param trickPoint  whether the play took the trick
 * @param points      what the row scored in total, never more than two

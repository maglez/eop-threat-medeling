/**
 * Decides which address to treat as the caller's.
 *
 * <p>In the deployed topology Caddy is the only published entry point (ADR-017), so the
 * peer address the servlet container sees is Caddy's and the caller's own address only
 * survives in {@code X-Forwarded-For}. Caddy appends, so the last entry of that header is
 * the one Caddy wrote and everything before it is whatever the caller chose to send.
 *
 * <p>That reasoning is only valid if the peer actually is Caddy, and until EOP-26 nothing
 * checked. Reached without a proxy in front — the ordinary local run, or any peer inside the
 * container network — a caller could send the header itself and hand
 * {@link InMemoryJoinAttemptLimiter} whatever key it liked, changing it once per request so
 * that ten failures per minute were never counted against anything. ADR-019 relies on that
 * throttle as a primary security control, so the fix is not defence in depth but the
 * restoration of the control itself.
 *
 * <p>The header is therefore read only when the peer is on an explicit allow-list, and the
 * value it yields must itself be an IP literal — a proxy that wrote something else, or an
 * {@code unknown} placeholder, falls back to the peer rather than becoming a bucket of its
 * own. Both addresses are reduced to one canonical spelling, because two spellings of one
 * client would otherwise be two buckets.

     * Used when, and only when, the servlet container reports no peer at all, meaning
     * {@code getRemoteAddr()} returned null or blank.
     *
     * <p>It deliberately does not cover the other way an address can fail to resolve. A peer
     * that is present but is not an IP literal is returned as {@code peer.strip()}, so that
     * raw string — not this sentinel — becomes the throttle key. Read the name as "no peer
     * was reported", not as "the peer could not be understood"; ADR-021 records the
     * non-literal case as a known limitation.
     *
     * <p>It cannot collide with a real address, because {@link IpLiterals} would reject it,
     * and neither it nor any resolved address can collide with the limiter's own sentinels,
     * which are prefixed with U+0000: that character is not whitespace, so {@code strip()}
     * would not remove it, and a servlet container cannot produce it in a peer address.

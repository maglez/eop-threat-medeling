/**
 * The set of peer addresses whose forwarding headers this application believes.
 *
 * <p>An empty set trusts nobody, and that is the default (ADR-021). Running the application
 * directly — {@code ./mvnw spring-boot:run}, an integration test, a container reached from
 * a sibling container — therefore ignores {@code X-Forwarded-For} entirely and keys the
 * join throttle on the real peer. That ordering matters: before EOP-26 the header was read
 * unconditionally, so any caller could nominate its own rate-limiter bucket and rotate it
 * once per guess. ADR-019 calls that throttle a primary security control rather than
 * defence in depth, so leaving the decision implicit was not an option.
 *
 * <p>Entries are literal addresses, which mean that host alone, or CIDR blocks. A block
 * whose host bits are not clear is rejected rather than quietly masked, because masking
 * turns the plausible typo {@code 10.0.0.5/8} into a rule that trusts sixteen million
 * hosts. Malformed entries are rejected for the same reason: skipping them would leave an
 * application that starts happily and trusts less than its configuration claims, and the
 * only evidence would be a log line nobody reads. A bad allow-list fails the bean, and a
 * failed bean fails startup, which is noticed immediately.

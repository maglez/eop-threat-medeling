/**
 * Limits how many read requests one client address may make per minute, across every read route.
 *
 * <p>Introduced by EOP-88 (ADR-051). Before it, no read route was rate limited at all: the two existing limiters
 * cover session creation and join attempts, both of which are writes. {@code GET /leaderboard} was the route that
 * prompted the ticket, because it re-derives every score from the session's whole trick history on each read
 * (ADR-030) and the game-over screen offers a retry button that issues one such read per click.
 *
 * <p><strong>Why an interceptor and not a servlet filter.</strong> A filter runs outside the
 * {@code DispatcherServlet}, so a {@link RateLimitedException} thrown there would never reach
 * {@code GlobalExceptionHandler} and the problem+json body would have to be written by hand — a second place that
 * renders errors, which {@code error-handling.md} forbids. {@link HandlerInterceptor#preHandle} runs inside the
 * dispatcher, so the throw is mapped to 429 with an RFC 9457 body and a {@code Retry-After} header by the handler
 * that already exists. The alternatives are compared in ADR-051.
 *
 * <p><strong>The key is the resolved client address and nothing else.</strong> It comes from
 * {@link ClientAddressResolver}, so a client-supplied {@code X-Forwarded-For} is honoured only when the peer is a
 * configured trusted proxy — and {@code eop.web.trusted-proxies} is empty by default, so by default no header can
 * influence it (ADR-021). {@code server.forward-headers-strategy: none} is a second, independent guard: the
 * container never rewrites {@code getRemoteAddr()} from a header either.
 *
 * <p>Keying on the player token was considered and rejected. A token is client-supplied and unvalidated at this
 * layer, so an attacker could present a fresh bogus token per request; since the counter must fail closed when its
 * key table saturates, that would turn a spoofable header into a way to refuse service to everyone. An address is
 * the coarsest thing a caller cannot choose. The cost is that players sharing one NAT share one allowance, which
 * the limit is sized to absorb.
 *
 * <p><strong>Scope.</strong> Registered on {@code /api/v1/**} so that a read route added later is covered without
 * anyone remembering to add it, and refuses nothing but GET and HEAD — writes keep their own dedicated limiters.
 * The SSE stream is excluded at registration; see the configurer for why.

/**
 * HTTP access to the facilitator's early-end operation.
 *
 * <p>This bean only exists when {@code eop.features.trick-play} is true (ADR-013).
 * The end-session route is part of the trick-play feature because it is only
 * meaningful once a hand is in progress: ending a session that has never been
 * dealt is a state error, not a lifecycle operation. While the flag is off there
 * are no handlers for this path and Spring's own no-handler response answers it.
 *
 * <p><strong>The acting player is never read from a request.</strong> The caller's
 * credential is taken from the header and passed to the use case, which resolves
 * it to exactly one seated player and verifies they are the facilitator (ADR-015).
 *
 * <p>The credential header is declared {@code required = false} for the same reason
 * as in {@link SessionController}: a missing credential is a refused request, not a
 * malformed one, so the null travels to the use case and a missing and an
 * unrecognised token leave as the same 403.
 *
 * <p>{@link SessionController#PLAYER_TOKEN_HEADER} is referenced rather than copied,
 * and deliberately not lifted into a shared constants class. Such a class would hold
 * one compile-time-constant {@code String} and a private constructor; since the
 * constant is inlined by the compiler and the constructor is never called, JaCoCo
 * would find no covered instruction in it, and the coverage gate admits no
 * per-class exclusions.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here logs. That is not an omission: ADR-026 is {@code Proposed} and has
 * not yet decided where use-case observability lives. Adding a logger to this one
 * controller would pick that option in a feature slice, and would break the
 * uniformity that ADR-026 records as the reason the gap is tolerable at all.
 *
 * <p>Descriptions here are deliberately brief: {@code docs/api/openapi.yml} is the
 * contract (ADR-004), springdoc is disabled by default (ADR-049), and prose duplicated in
 * two places is how the two come to disagree.

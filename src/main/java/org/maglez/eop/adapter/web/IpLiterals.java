/**
 * Parses IP addresses written as text, without consulting DNS.
 *
 * <p>The obvious implementation, {@link InetAddress#getByName(String)} on its own, is not
 * safe here. Handed something that is not a literal it performs a name lookup, so a
 * malformed entry in the trusted-proxy allow-list would become a network call during
 * startup, and a hostile {@code X-Forwarded-For} value would become a network call on the
 * request path. An allow-list whose meaning depends on what a resolver says today is also
 * not an allow-list. Every method here therefore refuses anything that is not a literal.
 *
 * <p>Two shapes are recognised. Text containing a colon is delegated to the platform, but
 * only after {@link #isAddressText(String)} has checked it character by character, and that
 * check is the whole of what keeps this class off the resolver. The platform offers no such
 * guarantee, and the belief that a colon is itself protection is false: measured on Java
 * 21.0.12, {@code getByName} attempts literal parsing only when the first character is a
 * hex digit or a colon, so {@code zzz:80}, {@code localhost:80}, {@code _:_} and even
 * {@code .a:b} are all handed to {@code getaddrinfo}, taking up to a quarter of a second to
 * fail with a resolver error rather than a parse error. Nothing may reach that call unless
 * its own spelling has already ruled a hostname out. Everything else is parsed as a strict
 * dotted quad by hand, because the platform has historically accepted abbreviated and octal
 * forms in which {@code 010.1.1.1} and {@code 8.1.1.1} name the same host. Two spellings of
 * one address are two rate-limiter buckets, which is the very defect this class exists to
 * help close, so the loose forms are rejected instead.
 *
 * <p>{@link #canonical(String)} exists for the same reason. An address is used as a key in
 * {@link InMemoryJoinAttemptLimiter}, and {@code 10.0.0.1} and {@code ::ffff:10.0.0.1} are
 * the same client. Reducing both to one spelling before counting means an attacker cannot
 * be handed a fresh, empty bucket merely by rewriting the address it already controls.
 *
 * <p>{@code InetAddress.ofLiteral} would replace most of this, but it arrived in Java 22
 * and this project targets 21.

     * <p>Three independent conditions must hold, and each one alone would close the resolver
     * path for most input. The address part must contain a colon; every one of its characters
     * must be a hex digit, a colon or a dot; and its first character must be a hex digit or a
     * colon, which is the same condition the JDK uses to choose literal parsing over
     * resolution. The first character is checked separately rather than left to the alphabet
     * because a dot is a legal address character but a leading dot is not a legal literal, and
     * {@code .a:b} passes an alphabet check yet still reaches {@code getaddrinfo}.
     *
     * <p>A scope suffix is permitted and may be named, not merely numeric. Names such as
     * {@code eth0.100} and {@code br-lan} carry digits, dots, hyphens and underscores, so those
     * characters are admitted. Being admitted by this guard is not the same as parsing, though,
     * and the platform can refuse for two distinct reasons. It rejects a name no interface
     * carries, with {@code no such interface}. It also rejects a name whose interface exists but
     * has no IPv6 link-local address and therefore no scope id, with {@code no scope_id found} —
     * measured on {@code fe80::1%en0}. So {@code %lo0} parses on a host with an interface of that
     * name carrying a link-local address, and fails both on a host that calls its loopback
     * {@code lo} and on one whose loopback carries {@code ::1/128} alone. This guard governs
     * which spellings may reach the platform; the platform decides whether they resolve. Either
     * refusal is against the interface table and never against DNS, and both are instant — which
     * is why widening the scope alphabet cannot reopen the resolver path. The address part is
     * validated on its own.

/**
 * Servlet filter that establishes a correlation ID for every HTTP request (EOP-117).
 *
 * <p>On each request the filter:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Reads the {@value #HEADER_NAME} request header.</li>
 *   <li>If the header is absent or blank, generates a fresh {@link UUID} as the ID.</li>
 *   <li>Puts the ID into the SLF4J {@link MDC} under the key {@value #MDC_KEY} so that every
 *       log line emitted during the request carries it automatically — in the plain-text pattern
 *       via {@code %X{correlationId}} and in the JSON encoder as an MDC field.</li>
 *   <li>Echoes the ID back to the caller in the {@value #HEADER_NAME} response header so that
 *       clients can correlate their own logs with server-side traces.</li>
  *   <li>Clears the MDC entry via a try-with-resources {@code MdcCleaner} so that no ID leaks
 *       into a subsequent request on the same thread (thread-pool reuse).</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p><strong>Security note:</strong> the filter reads {@value #HEADER_NAME} directly from the
 * request and never inspects {@code X-Forwarded-For} or any other proxy header. This is
 * consistent with {@code server.forward-headers-strategy: none} (ADR-021) and the principle
 * that the application must not trust headers it cannot verify. A caller-supplied correlation ID
 * is accepted as-is for traceability convenience; it is never used for authentication,
 * authorisation or rate-limiting decisions.
 *
 * <p>The filter is registered by {@code ObservabilityConfiguration} at
 * {@link org.springframework.core.Ordered#HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE} so the MDC key is available to
 * every other filter, interceptor and controller in the chain.

 *
 * <p>Server-sent events over the emitter that ships with Spring MVC, so no new
 * dependency and no second protocol (ADR-014).
 *
 * <p><strong>The registry is a broadcast list, not a presence list.</strong> An
 * entry means "the last write to this connection succeeded", which is a weaker claim
 * than "somebody is there": a client that closed its laptop lid is only discovered on
 * the next write. The EOP-8 spike watched this happen — two subscribers reported
 * live after both browsers had gone. Anything that needs to know who is actually
 * present must ask the database, and {@code connectionStatus} is documented as
 * advisory for the same reason.
 *
 * <p><strong>No event history is kept.</strong> There is nothing to replay and
 * {@code Last-Event-ID} is not honoured, because a restart resets any counter and an
 * identifier minted by a previous process names an event this one cannot produce.
 * Reconnection is a re-read of {@code GET /api/v1/sessions/{sessionId}}, never a
 * replay. Keeping a replayable log would mean a second source of truth, and the
 * database is the only authority.
 *
 * <p><strong>Publishing never fails <em>or delays</em> the request that triggered
 * it.</strong> A departed subscriber is the normal case, not an error: a player
 * whose join succeeded must not receive a failure because somebody else closed a
 * tab. Nor may it receive a slow one. Swallowing {@code IOException} only ever
 * covered half of that promise, because a peer that has stopped draining its
 * socket makes the write <em>block</em> instead of throwing; until EOP-223 the
 * fan-out ran on the triggering request's own thread, so one such peer stalled
 * that request for tens of seconds while logging nothing at all. Per-subscriber
 * writes are handed to a bounded pool and the caller does not wait for them.
 *
 * <p><strong>Subscriber caps prevent unbounded resource consumption (EOP-20, ADR-034).</strong>
 * A per-session cap of {@value #MAX_SUBSCRIBERS_PER_SESSION} (2× MAXIMUM_PLAYERS to allow
 * reconnect churn) and a global cap of {@value #MAX_TOTAL_SUBSCRIBERS} are enforced before
 * any emitter is created. Both caps throw {@link TooManySubscribersException}, mapped to
 * HTTP 429 by {@code GlobalExceptionHandler}.

     * Handing the writes to the pool bounds the caller's cost to the submissions themselves
     * and stops one stalled reader delaying either the caller or the other subscribers
     * (EOP-223). It is what {@code beat()} already did for the heartbeat sweep, and for the
     * same reason (EOP-20, ADR-034).

     *
     * <p><strong>Every event gets its own write.</strong> Notifications are deliberately not
     * coalesced per subscriber: a frame is a doorbell, and only a <em>named</em> frame makes a
     * client re-read {@code GET /api/v1/sessions/{sessionId}}. Skipping one because another
     * write happened to be in flight would therefore lose it outright whenever the write in

     * learns its hand was dealt. Coalescing was measured on the EOP-217 suite and moved
     * nothing, so the lossless shape is kept (EOP-223).
     *
     * <p>Two consequences of the hand-off are worth knowing. Eviction of a departed
     * subscriber now happens on a pool thread, so {@code subscriberCount} is eventually
     * rather than immediately consistent after a publish. And a write that fails for a
     * reason other than a departed peer can no longer reach the caller, so it is logged

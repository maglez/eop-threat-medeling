/**
 * The change-notification stream for one session.
 *
 * <p>Split out of {@link SessionController} by EOP-190, which found that controller
 * holding eight collaborators. The seam was chosen rather than settled by arithmetic:
 * of the five session routes, this is the only one that holds
 * {@link ResolvePlayerUseCase} or {@link SseSessionEventPublisher}, and it is the only
 * one that holds nothing else. So the cut leaves no collaborator on both sides — the
 * alternative candidate, lifting session creation out, would have had to keep
 * {@link ClientAddressResolver} in both classes, because joining reads the caller's
 * address too.
 *
 * <p>It is also the one route that is a different protocol. Everything else here is a
 * request and a response; this is a connection held open for the length of a game,
 * answering with {@code text/event-stream} and failing in ways the others cannot — a
 * subscriber limit, a client that goes away without saying so. Keeping that in its own
 * class is what stops those concerns leaking into the four short-lived handlers.
 *
 * <p>This bean only exists when {@code eop.features.session-lifecycle} is true, on the
 * same condition and for the same reasons as {@link SessionController} (ADR-013,
 * ADR-019). The condition is repeated here rather than inherited, because a flag that
 * governs a feature must be repeated on every bean that opens the flagged state — the
 * flag would otherwise leave this route serving while the rest of the lifecycle was
 * withheld, which is the fail-open shape {@code .opencode/rules/feature-flags.md}
 * forbids. {@code SessionControllerDisabledIntegrationTest} asserts this bean's
 * absence, not only that the route answers 404.
 *
 * <p>The credential arrives in {@link SessionController#PLAYER_TOKEN_HEADER}, the same
 * header as everywhere else. The constant stays where it is because it is not this
 * route's property — it is the whole API's — and {@code PlayerTokenHeaderContractTest}
 * pins it against {@code docs/api/openapi.yml} from there.

     * Opens a stream of change notifications for one session.
     *
     * <p>The credential is resolved before the stream is opened, so an unrecognised
     * caller receives a problem detail rather than an empty stream that would look
     * like a session where nothing ever happens.
     *
     * <p>The credential arrives in the same header as everywhere else, and there is
     * no query-parameter alternative — not because one was rejected during review,
     * but because no code path here reads one. The browser's {@code EventSource} API
     * cannot set request headers, so the client uses {@code fetch}-based streaming
     * instead; that cost is accepted because a credential in a query string is a
     * credential in the access log, in the browser history, and on screen during a
     * shared call (ADR-019).
     *
     * <p>What arrives on this stream is notification, never state. Each frame says
     * that the session changed; the client then re-reads
     * {@code GET /api/v1/sessions/{sessionId}}. There is no history, so
     * {@code Last-Event-ID} is not honoured.

     * @param sessionId   the session to watch
     * @param playerToken the caller's identity credential
     * @return an open server-sent event stream

/**
 * A threat card as it crosses the HTTP boundary.

 * <p>Domain entities never leave the application, so this is what the API
 * returns. The separation is not ceremony: it means a change to the domain shape
 * does not silently become a breaking API change, and the field names here are
 * governed by {@code docs/api/openapi.yml} rather than by Java conventions.
 *
 * <p>{@code rank} is published three ways on purpose. The name is what code
 * should switch on, the symbol is what a card face shows, and the value is what a
 * client can compare numerically without knowing the enum order.
 *
 * @param cardId       stable identifier
 * @param suit         the STRIDE category
 * @param rank         the rank constant name
 * @param rankSymbol   how the rank is printed on the card
 * @param rankValue    numeric rank, ace high at 14
 * @param threatPrompt the threat described on the card face

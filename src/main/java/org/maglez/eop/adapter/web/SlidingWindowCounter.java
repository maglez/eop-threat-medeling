/**
 * Counts events per key over a rolling one-minute window and refuses the event that would exceed a limit.
 *
 * <p>This is the mechanism behind the read-route rate limit introduced by EOP-88 (ADR-051). It is deliberately
 * free of any notion of <em>what</em> is being counted: it takes an opaque key, and the caller decides what that
 * key means. {@code ReadRateLimitInterceptor} keys on the resolved client address; a future caller might key on
 * something else.
 *
 * <p><strong>The check and the record are one atomic step.</strong> {@link #admit(String)} prunes the window,
 * tests the limit and inserts the new timestamp while holding a single lock on that key's window, so two threads
 * arriving at {@code limit - 1} cannot both be admitted. There is no separate "may I?" method: a lock-free
 * pre-check would be stale by the time the caller acted on it, and a caller that acted on a stale answer would be
 * reintroducing exactly the race this class exists to close. {@code InMemorySessionCreationLimiter} does expose
 * such a pre-check, but only because its use case needs a cheap early refusal before doing database work; an
 * interceptor has no such work to avoid.
 *
 * <p><strong>Saturation fails closed.</strong> The key table is bounded at {@code maxTrackedKeys}. When it is
 * full and the key is new, empty windows are evicted and the test repeated; if the table is still full the event
 * is refused rather than admitted untracked. A flood of distinct keys is itself an attack pattern, and admitting
 * requests that cannot be counted would let an attacker bypass the limiter by exhausting the table first — the
 * same reasoning ADR-033 records for the creation and join limiters.
 *
 * <p><strong>The counters are in memory and are forgotten on restart.</strong> That is acceptable for the same
 * reason it is acceptable for the other two limiters: a restart is a deployment, and a deployment is not
 * something an attacker can trigger. A shared store would be the right answer for more than one instance, and
 * there is one instance (ADR-012).
 *
 * <p>Two races are reachable only at saturation and are accepted rather than locked out. The tracked-key count
 * can overshoot {@code maxTrackedKeys} slightly, because the saturation test and the insertion of the new window
 * are not one atomic step. And a window evicted while another thread holds it loses that thread's count. Both
 * cost at most a handful of admitted events at the point where the table is already full, and closing them would
 * mean a global lock on every request.
 *
 * <p>This class is package-private and stateful; it is held by a Spring-managed component rather than being a
 * bean itself, so that one process can run several independently-configured counters.

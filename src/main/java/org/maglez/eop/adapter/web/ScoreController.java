/**
 * Reads the score of a session.
 *
 * <p>Its own controller rather than a sixth handler on the trick routes. Those are about dealing,
 * playing and resolving — things that change the table — and this only reads what they have already
 * done. It carries the same feature flag, because a score of a game nobody can play is nothing worth
 * publishing.
 *
 * <p>One route, and the plural in its response is deliberate and worth saying out loud, because the
 * hand route is forbidden to have one. {@code /hand} is singular because a collection of every hand
 * must never exist (ADR-027), and a score sheet is by construction every player's rows. What makes
 * that legitimate here is the content, not the shape: a score names only cards that have already been
 * played face up, so it discloses nothing the players at the table cannot already see, whereas a hand
 * names cards its holder alone is entitled to see. The prohibition is on exposing every player's
 * private state through one route, and there is no private state in a score.
 *
 * <p>The caller is identified by the credential header and nothing else. No path variable, query
 * parameter or body field names a player, so there is no way to ask for somebody else's view (ADR-015).
 *
 * <p>Nothing here logs, for the same reason nothing in the other controllers does: ADR-026 is still
 * proposed, and one of the arrangements it weighs is logging at the web boundary. Adding a logger to
 * one controller would settle that in a feature slice.

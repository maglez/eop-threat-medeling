/**
 * Counts successful session creations in a sliding window, in this process's memory.
 *
 * <p>Creating a session requires no credential and inserts a permanent row. Without a
 * limit, an unauthenticated caller can flood the database at the rate of the network:
 * at 500 req/s that is 43 million rows per day, filling the join-code keyspace and
 * causing legitimate facilitators to receive opaque 503s once the 5-attempt collision
 * retry exhausts (ADR-033).
 *
 * <p><strong>Only one window.</strong> Unlike the join limiter, only the per-address
 * window is needed here. There is no per-code analogue: a session does not exist until
 * it is created, so there is no code to walk. The address window alone is sufficient
 * to prevent a single caller from flooding the table.
 *
 * <p><strong>Reserve-before-work.</strong> {@link #recordCreation} is the authoritative
 * atomic gate and must be called <em>before</em> any database work. If the downstream
 * use case fails, the caller must invoke {@link #refundCreation} to return the slot so
 * that a transient error does not permanently consume a creation allowance.
 *
 * <p><strong>Successes are counted, not failures.</strong> A facilitator who creates
 * five lobbies in a minute is the pattern being limited; there is no "wrong answer"
 * equivalent to a failed join. Counting failures would allow unlimited successful
 * creations, which is the attack vector.
 *
 * <p><strong>The counters are in memory and are forgotten on restart.</strong> This
 * is an accepted risk rather than an oversight: a restart is a deployment, and a
 * deployment is not something an attacker can trigger. A shared store would be the
 * right answer for more than one instance, and there is one instance (ADR-012).
 *
 * <p><strong>Fail-closed on saturation.</strong> When the tracked-key table is full
 * and a new address arrives, the attempt is refused rather than silently admitted.
 * The refusal is issued in {@link #checkAllowed}, before any database work, so a
 * saturated table costs no lookup. A flood of distinct keys is itself an attack
 * pattern; admitting requests that cannot be tracked would let an attacker bypass
 * the limiter by exhausting the table first (ADR-033).
 *
 * <p><strong>Atomic check-and-record.</strong> The prune, the limit check, and the
 * insertion are performed under the same lock on the window deque. This prevents two
 * concurrent threads from both passing the limit check before either records its
 * creation. {@link #checkAllowed} is a best-effort pre-check that takes no lock; the
 * authoritative atomic gate is the synchronized block in {@link #recordCreation}.

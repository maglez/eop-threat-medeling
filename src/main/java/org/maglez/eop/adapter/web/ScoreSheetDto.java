/**
 * The whole score of one session: the Score Card's rows and the standings derived from them.
 *
 * <p>This is every player's rows in one response, which the hand route is forbidden to be. The
 * difference is what is in them. A score names only cards that have already been played, so it
 * discloses nothing the table cannot already see; a hand names cards its holder alone is entitled to
 * see, which is why there is one hand route and it only ever shows the caller's own (ADR-027).
 *
 * <p>Both lists are always present. Before any card is played {@code rows} is empty and every
 * standing sits on nothing, which is the score of a game that has not started rather than a missing
 * answer.
 *
 * <p>There is deliberately no winner field. The winner is whoever holds position 1, and if that
 * position is shared then the game is tied — a fact the standings already carry, and one a second
 * field could only contradict. {@code ScoreSheet} does answer {@code leaders()} and
 * {@code leadIsShared()}, and both are left in the domain for the same reason: they are views of the
 * standings, and publishing a derived view alongside what it derives from invites the two to
 * disagree.
 *
 * @param rows      one row per card played, in trick order and, within a trick, in the order played
 * @param standings one standing per seated player, ordered by position and then by seat

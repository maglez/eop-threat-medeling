 *
 * <p>This is the only response in the API that carries a credential, and the only
 * time that credential is ever transmitted. The application stores its digest and
 * nothing else, so a client that loses the value cannot be sent it again — it can
 * only rejoin as a new player (ADR-015).
 *
 * @param playerToken the opaque credential, to be kept in session storage and sent
 *                    in the {@code X-EoP-Player-Token} header
 * @param playerId    which of the seated players the caller is, supplied so the
 *                    client does not have to guess by matching a non-unique name
 * @param session     the session as it now stands

/**
 * Counts failed join attempts in a sliding window, in this process's memory.
 *
 * <p>This is a security control, not a courtesy about load. A join code is eight
 * characters over a thirty-two symbol alphabet: exactly forty bits, or about 1.1
 * trillion possibilities. Ten failures a minute allows roughly fourteen thousand
 * guesses a day from one address, so a single attacker is not the interesting case
 * and never was. What this class bounds is the guess rate <em>per address</em>; what
 * bounds the search overall is the length of the code.
 *
 * <p>Read the two together, because neither is sufficient alone. Against a pool of
 * a thousand proxied addresses and a few dozen lobbies live at any moment, the
 * expected time to stumble onto a real session is years at forty bits. The same
 * pool needed days when the code was six characters, which is why EOP-24 lengthened
 * it — an earlier version of this comment claimed centuries, but that arithmetic
 * quietly assumed the attacker owned one address. Note also that the per-code
 * window below does nothing against such a search: every guess is a different code
 * and lands in its own fresh counter, so only the per-address window ever fires.
 * Any change that weakens either is a security change and should be reviewed as
 * one (ADR-019).
 *
 * <p><strong>Only failures are counted.</strong> A facilitator shares one code with
 * five people who all join successfully, and none of them should be throttled. An
 * attacker walking the keyspace produces nothing but misses. Counting successes
 * would penalise the first case to no benefit in the second.
 *
 * <p><strong>Two windows, not one.</strong> The address window stops one client
 * trying many codes. The code window stops many clients trying one code, which is
 * what a shared or leaked partial code looks like. Either window alone leaves the
 * other attack open.
 *
 * <p><strong>The code key is normalised before it is counted.</strong> Counting the
 * raw string would let an attacker vary the case, or substitute an {@code O} for a
 * zero, to be handed a fresh bucket for every guess — which is the same as having no
 * per-code limit at all. Anything that could never be a code shares a single bucket,
 * because those attempts are still attempts.
 *
 * <p><strong>The counters are in memory and are forgotten on restart.</strong> This
 * is an accepted risk rather than an oversight: a restart is a deployment, and a
 * deployment is not something an attacker can trigger. A shared store would be the
 * right answer for more than one instance, and there is one instance (ADR-012).
 *
 * <p><strong>Fail-closed on saturation.</strong> When the tracked-key table is full
 * and a new address or code arrives, the attempt is refused rather than silently
 * admitted. The refusal is issued in {@link #checkAllowed}, before any database
 * work, so a saturated table costs no lookup. A flood of distinct keys is itself an
 * attack pattern; admitting requests that cannot be tracked would let an attacker
 * bypass the limiter by exhausting the table first (ADR-019).
 *
 * <p><strong>Atomic check-and-record.</strong> The prune, the limit check, and the
 * insertion for each window are performed under the same lock on the window deque.
 * This prevents two concurrent threads from both passing the limit check before
 * either records its failure. {@link #checkAllowed} is a best-effort pre-check that
 * takes no lock; the authoritative atomic gate is the synchronized block in
 * {@link #recordFailure}.
 *
 * <p><strong>Lock discipline.</strong> The only method that mutates a window deque
 * is {@link #recordFailure} (via {@link #recordInWindow}), and it always does so
 * inside {@code synchronized(window)}. {@link #refuseIfExhausted} mutates nothing.
 * {@link #checkAllowed} mutates no deque, though it may remove aged-out map entries
 * via {@link #evictEmptyWindows} (a map mutation, not a deque mutation).
 * {@link #evictEmptyWindows} removes map entries whose deques are aged out;
 * it never calls {@code pollFirst} or {@code addLast} on any deque. A bounded race
 * exists: a freshly-created empty deque can be evicted before its first
 * {@code addLast}, causing one failure to be silently lost under saturation. See
 * {@link #evictEmptyWindows} for the full analysis.
 *
 * <p><strong>Both windows are always evaluated.</strong> The address window is not
 * allowed to short-circuit the code window: either window alone leaves the other
 * attack open. In {@link #recordFailure}, both windows are always recorded, even if
 * one is at saturation. A saturation condition in one window silently drops that
 * window's record but does not suppress the other.

/**
 * HTTP access to trick play: deal the deck, read your own hand, play a card, read the
 * state of play and resolve the trick once every seat that still holds cards has played.
 *
 * <p>This bean only exists when {@code eop.features.trick-play} is true (ADR-013).
 * That flag is separate from {@code eop.features.session-lifecycle} on purpose, so
 * the lobby can be live while trick play is held back. While it is off there are no
 * handlers for these paths and Spring's own no-handler response answers them, which
 * is already a problem detail. Nothing here branches on the flag at request time.
 *
 * <p><strong>The acting seat is never read from a request.</strong> Every handler
 * takes the caller's credential from the header and passes it to a use case, which
 * resolves it to exactly one seated player (ADR-015). No path variable, query
 * parameter or body field names a seat, a player or a card's suit and rank. Two
 * defects fixed earlier in this story were exactly that: a caller-supplied seat let a
 * player play out of somebody else's hand, and a caller-supplied suit and rank let a
 * forged card take a trick.
 *
 * <p>The credential header is declared {@code required = false} for the same reason
 * as in {@link SessionController}: a missing credential is a refused request, not a
 * malformed one, so the null travels to the use case and a missing and an
 * unrecognised token leave as the same 403.
 *
 * <p>{@link SessionController#PLAYER_TOKEN_HEADER} is referenced rather than copied,
 * and deliberately not lifted into a shared constants class. Such a class would hold
 * one compile-time-constant {@code String} and a private constructor; since the
 * constant is inlined by the compiler and the constructor is never called, JaCoCo
 * would find no covered instruction in it, and the coverage gate admits no
 * per-class exclusions.
 *
 * <p>Audit logging for game-affecting writes lives here, at the HTTP boundary (ADR-026,
 * option 4, Accepted 2026-08-17 by EOP-70). Each write endpoint emits one {@code INFO}
 * line naming the session and the actor's token prefix; card identities are never logged
 * because a hand is private (ADR-026 §CWE-117 and hidden-information constraints).
 *
 * <p>Descriptions here are deliberately brief: {@code docs/api/openapi.yml} is the
 * contract (ADR-004), springdoc is disabled by default (ADR-049), and prose duplicated in
 * two places is how the two come to disagree.

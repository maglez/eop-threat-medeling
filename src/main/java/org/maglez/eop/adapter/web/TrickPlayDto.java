 * <p>{@code seatOrder} is published but is never read from a request. It is derived from the identity
 * token of the request that made the play, and {@code PlayCardRequest} has no field for it. A client
 * that could name the seat could play out of another player's hand, which is a defect this project
 * has already had once.
 *
 * <p>Annotated {@link JsonInclude} so an absent note is an absent field rather than a null one. The
 * contract says {@code notes} is either a string or not there; {@code "notes": null} would be a third
 * state that no schema describes.
 *
 * @param trickPlayId  identifier of this play
 * @param playerId     the player who made it
 * @param seatOrder    the seat it was made from, taken from the token and never from a body
 * @param card         the card played
 * @param threatLinked whether the player linked the threat to their model
 * @param components   the components the threat was linked to, empty when none
 * @param notes        what the player wrote, absent when they wrote nothing
 * @param playedAt     when the play was recorded, ISO-8601 in UTC

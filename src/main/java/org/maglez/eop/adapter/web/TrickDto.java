/**
 * A trick and the cards played into it, as they cross the HTTP boundary.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately silent on three things a client will want: whose turn it is, whether the trick is
 * complete, and which seat leads next. All three depend on which seats still hold cards, which is not
 * part of a trick — after the uneven deal some seats run out before others (ADR-023) — so answering
 * them from here would mean guessing. They belong to a state read over the whole session.
 *
 * <p>{@code winningSeat} is taken from {@link Trick#winner()} rather than from
 * {@code Trick.winningSeat()}, which throws when the trick is unresolved. Reading the winner through
 * the {@link java.util.Optional} keeps the unresolved case an ordinary branch instead of an exception
 * that would surface as a 500 for a perfectly normal mid-trick response.
 *
 * <p>Annotated {@link JsonInclude} so the absence of {@code winningSeat} and {@code ledSuit} is what
 * distinguishes an unresolved trick and a just-opened one, exactly as the contract says. Nulls would
 * be a state no schema describes.
 *
 * @param trickId     identifier of this trick
 * @param sequence    which trick of the hand this is, counting from one
 * @param leaderSeat  the seat that led it
 * @param ledSuit     the STRIDE category that must be followed, absent until the first card is played
 * @param plays       the cards played, in play order from the leader clockwise
 * @param winningSeat the seat that took the trick, absent until the trick is resolved

 * announces that something changed and never what it changed to, so there is one
 * producer of state and one endpoint reporting it, and the path a client takes
 * after a reconnect is the same path it took on first load (ADR-014).
 *
 * <p>Players appear in ascending seat order because that is the order play moves
 * around the table. A client must not re-sort them, and in particular must not
 * order them by anything derived from when they joined.

 * @param status    where the session is in its lifecycle

 * @param createdAt when the lobby opened, ISO-8601 in UTC
 * @param updatedAt when the session last changed, ISO-8601 in UTC

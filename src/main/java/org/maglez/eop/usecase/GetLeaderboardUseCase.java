/**
 * Reads the final leaderboard for a completed session.
 *
 * <p>The leaderboard is only available once the session is in
 * {@link SessionStatus#COMPLETED} state. Requesting it while the session is still
 * in progress is a conflict — the resource exists but is not yet in the right state.
 *
 * <p>Any seated player may read the leaderboard. The result is public knowledge once
 * the game ends: every card has been played face up and the scores are derived from
 * those plays. Membership is still required so that a stranger who guesses a session
 * identifier cannot read the result (ADR-024).
 *
 * <p>Returns a {@link LeaderboardResult} carrying the resolved {@link SessionStatus} and the derived
 * {@link ScoreSheet}, so the controller can build the full leaderboard DTO (including the per-suit
 * STRIDE breakdown) from a single use-case call and without inventing the status itself.
 *
 * <p>The persisted {@code GameResult} row is read here but deliberately not returned. Scores are
 * recomputed from the trick history on every read (ADR-030), so the row holds nothing this endpoint
 * serves — it is an existence gate, and absent it the caller gets
 * {@link GameResultNotRecordedException} rather than a leaderboard derived from a game whose result
 * was never recorded. Until EOP-87 it was carried out through {@code LeaderboardResult} as a
 * non-null component that no consumer read.
 *
 * <p>Pure use case: no Spring, no Jakarta imports.

/**
 * Port through which the application reads and writes tricks and the plays made into
 * them.
 *
 * <p>As with {@link HandRepository}, a session identifier leads every signature because
 * {@link Trick} does not carry one — it holds an identifier, a sequence, a leader seat,
 * its plays and its winner, and nothing else.
 *
 * <p>Every write takes an {@code expectedLeaderSeat}. That is the compare-and-set
 * witness, and it is the whole turn-order guard: the statement names the leader seat the
 * caller's snapshot showed, and a snapshot taken before somebody else moved matches
 * nothing. The value is always derived — from the trick the caller read, or from
 * {@link HandRepository#findCurrentLeaderSeat} — and is never taken from a request body.
 * ADR-020 is explicit that serialisation rests on the row lock the conditional statement
 * takes rather than on the value it returns, and that {@code @Version} is mapped but is
 * deliberately not the enforcement mechanism.
 *
 * <p>The recorded leader seat advances <em>once per trick</em>, not once per play. A play
 * reads it and locks the row without changing it; a resolution moves it on. Whose turn it
 * is within a trick is derived by {@code Trick} from the plays already made, because the
 * trick's own plays already determine it and a stored per-play pointer would be a second
 * authority on a fact that is already written down.
 *
 * <p>Appending a play is one method rather than two on purpose. It removes the card from
 * a hand and records the play, and those must happen together: two transactions would
 * admit a card gone from a hand with no play recorded, or a play recorded for a card the
 * player still holds.
 *
 * <p>An earlier version of this paragraph justified that by claiming a single transaction
 * spanning two port calls would put {@code org.springframework.transaction} into this
 * package. That was false and is retracted. A caller in the outer ring can compose two
 * calls into one transaction without this package importing anything: both adapter methods
 * are already transactional, and Spring's default {@code REQUIRED} propagation makes them
 * join an enclosing transaction rather than start their own. Atomicity is reachable from
 * outside; the claim that it was not merely saved the argument from being made.
 *
 * <p>The reason that survives is about ownership. The transaction is a detail of the
 * persistence mechanism, so the ring that owns the mechanism should own its atomic unit.
 * Splitting this into two methods would move an invariant that is this port's
 * responsibility out to every caller, and a second place to state an invariant is a second
 * place for it to drift — a cost, deliberately paid here rather than passed upwards, not an
 * impossibility.
 *
 * <p><strong>Authorising the requester is the caller's obligation, not this port's.</strong>
 * Nothing here takes an acting player, so no implementation can check one. {@code
 * appendPlay} is the single exception and only partly: the play it is handed names a
 * player and a seat, and the implementation asserts those agree with the session's
 * seating — a check on the play, not on the requester. {@code openTrick} and {@code
 * recordResolution} carry no player at all, so for them there is no check to make here
 * and the use case is the only place one can happen. {@code expectedLeaderSeat} is a
 * turn-order witness and must never be read from a request body; it is not a substitute
 * for membership, since a stranger who guesses it correctly still passes it.

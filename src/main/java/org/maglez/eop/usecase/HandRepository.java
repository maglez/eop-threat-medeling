/**
 * Port through which the application reads and writes the hands dealt in a session.
 *
 * <p>A session identifier is the first parameter of every method because {@link Hands}
 * does not carry one. It holds a map of seat to hand and nothing else, so the session a
 * deal belongs to can only reach storage through the signature. That is deliberate:
 * putting a session identifier inside the aggregate would give two places to look for
 * the same fact.
 *
 * <p>The read returns the hands of the <em>whole session</em>, never one seat's hand,
 * and that is a correctness requirement rather than a convenience. {@code Hands}
 * enforces four invariants across seats when it is rebuilt — distinct players, distinct
 * hand identifiers, no empty deal, and no card held at two seats at once. Reconstituting
 * one seat at a time would satisfy every one of them vacuously. The last of those is the
 * one that matters most, because ADR-023 records that <em>no database constraint stands
 * behind it</em>: {@code pk_hand_card} stops a card appearing twice in one hand and
 * {@code uq_trick_play_trick_card} stops it being played twice into one trick, but
 * nothing stops the same card being dealt to two hands of the same session. The
 * {@code Hands} invariant is the only guard that exists, so a partial read would
 * silently switch off the only enforcement of a rule the ADR calls load-bearing.
 *
 * <p>The write methods are narrow and conditional, for the reasons
 * {@link SessionRepository} sets out. Each one names the state the caller observed, and
 * a write that would land on a session someone else has already moved on is refused
 * rather than applied. No method returns a row count: how many rows a conditional
 * statement changed is the storage layer's private protocol, and a port that leaked it
 * would oblige every caller to know what zero means.

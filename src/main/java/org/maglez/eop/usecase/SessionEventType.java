/**
 * The kinds of change a session can announce.
 *
 * <p>Each constant carries the name that appears on the wire. That name is fixed
 * by the published contract in {@code docs/api/openapi.yml}, so it is kept beside
 * the constant rather than in a translation table in the delivery layer, where the
 * two could drift apart without anything failing.
 *
 * <p>Pure domain-adjacent type: no Spring, no Jakarta, no persistence annotations.
 *
 * <p>Every constant here is published. {@link #HAND_DEALT}, {@link #CARD_PLAYED}
 * and {@link #TRICK_RESOLVED} were minted before anything emitted them, because a
 * wire name belongs to the contract and a client matching on a name must keep
 * working unchanged once the server starts sending it; EOP-14 Slice E wired the
 * publisher into the three trick-play use cases, so they are emitted now. That
 * asymmetry is deliberate and survives: a later release may begin emitting a name
 * declared here, but it may never rename one.
 *
 * <p>They reach a subscriber only where {@code eop.features.trick-play} is on,
 * which is a fact about a deployment rather than about this type.

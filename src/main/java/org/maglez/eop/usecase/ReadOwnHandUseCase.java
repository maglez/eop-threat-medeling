/**
 * Reads back the cards the requester is holding.
 *
 * <p>The only hand this can return is the caller's own, and that is a property of the code rather
 * than of the request: the seat is taken from the resolved identity token and nothing in the
 * signature can name another player. There is no sibling use case for another player's hand or for
 * every hand at once, because a game of Elevation of Privilege is unplayable if a hand can be read
 * by anyone but its holder, and the safest way to guarantee that is for the operation not to exist.
 *
 * <p>Authorising the requester is the first statement, as it is in every use case that touches this
 * data. {@link HandRepository} authorises nobody — no method on it takes an acting player — so this
 * layer is the only place the caller can be told apart from a stranger who guessed a session
 * identifier (ADR-024).
 *
 * <p>Deliberately no check on session status. A player may read their own hand whether the session is
 * in progress, completed or abandoned: the cards were dealt to them, they have seen them already,
 * and refusing the read once play ends would hide a player's own hand from them at exactly the moment
 * they want to look back over it. Nothing is disclosed that the caller did not already hold. Before
 * the deal there is no hand at all, which is {@link HandNotDealtException} and a 409 — a state that
 * changes, not a missing resource.
 *
 * <p>A read, so no clock and no writes: nothing here records that a player looked at their cards.

 * Port through which the application announces that a session changed.

 * player joined; they do not know that the announcement travels as a server-sent
 * event, and nothing in this layer imports the emitter type that carries it.
 *
 * <p>Publishing must not fail a request. A subscriber that has gone away without
 * saying so is the normal case rather than an exceptional one — the EOP-8 spike
 * watched the server report two live subscribers after both clients had been
 * killed — so the implementation drops the dead ones and returns. A player whose
 * join succeeded must not receive an error because somebody else's browser closed.

/**
 * Reports the state of play at a table: the current trick, whose turn it is, and what happens when
 * the trick is done.
 *
 * <p>This exists because a client otherwise cannot find out whose turn it is. The play and resolve
 * operations both answer with a {@link Trick}, and a {@link Trick} is deliberately silent on the seat
 * to play, on whether it is complete and on which seat leads next, because all three depend on the
 * seats that still hold cards — a fact about the session, not about one trick (ADR-023). Without this
 * read the only way to learn it is to attempt a play and be refused, which is a poor way to run a
 * turn.
 *
 * <p>Two repositories are read here rather than in the controller. The answer needs the trick and the
 * hands together, and stitching two aggregates is work for a use case: a web adapter that fetched the
 * second one would be making a rule about how they relate, in the layer least able to state it.
 *
 * <p>Any seated player may read it, and there is nothing to gate. Every part of the answer is already
 * public at the table — cards are played face up, and seats and turn order are visible to everyone
 * sitting at it. No card any seat is holding appears anywhere in the result, which is what separates
 * this from {@link ReadOwnHandUseCase}. A caller who holds no seat here is still refused, as
 * everywhere else: {@link HandRepository} and {@link TrickRepository} authorise nobody — no method on
 * either takes an acting player — so this layer is the only place a member is told from a stranger who
 * guessed a session identifier (ADR-024).
 *
 * <p>Deliberately no check on session status, for the same reason as {@link ReadOwnHandUseCase}:
 * looking back over the last trick after play ends is a reasonable thing to want, and nothing is
 * disclosed that was not already on the table. Before the deal there is no state of play at all, which
 * is {@link HandNotDealtException} and a 409 — a state that changes, rather than a missing resource, so
 * an empty answer would be the wrong shape for it.
 *
 * <p>A read, so no clock and no writes. Callers should prefer the event stream and use this to
 * recover, rather than polling it: an event says only that the session moved, and this is what it moved
 * to (ADR-014).

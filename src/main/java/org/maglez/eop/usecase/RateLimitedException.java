/**
 * Signals that a caller has been refused because it exceeded a rate limit.

 * throttled, so it can be thrown by any rate limiter in the application without
 * producing a misleading problem detail. The caller is told how long to wait; nothing
 * else is disclosed.
 *
 * <p>A plain Java exception with no Spring imports, per ADR-005. The application
 * layer does not know that HTTP exists, so it does not know that this becomes 429.
 *
 * <p>See also {@link TooManyJoinAttemptsException}, which is the join-specific
 * predecessor of this class and carries join-specific wording in its message.

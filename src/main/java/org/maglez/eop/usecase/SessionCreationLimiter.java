/**
 * Port through which session creation attempts are rate limited.
 *
 * <p>Creating a session requires no credential and inserts a permanent row. Without a
 * limit, an unauthenticated caller can flood the database at the rate of the network:
 * at 500 req/s that is 43 million rows per day, filling the join-code keyspace and
 * causing legitimate facilitators to receive opaque 503s once the 5-attempt collision
 * retry exhausts (ADR-033).
 *
 * <p>Unlike the join limiter, only the per-address window is needed here. There is no
 * per-code analogue: a session does not exist until it is created, so there is no code
 * to walk. The address window alone is sufficient to prevent a single caller from
 * flooding the table.
 *
 * <p>Implementations reserve a slot before any database work, so a refusal costs no
 * lookup. If the downstream use case fails, the reserved slot must be returned via
 * {@link #refundCreation} so that a transient error does not permanently consume a
 * creation allowance.

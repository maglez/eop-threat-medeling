/**
 * Plays one card from the acting player's hand into the current trick, opening a trick first if none
 * is open.
 *
 * <p>Opening lives here because the lead is not a separate act at the table: the first card played
 * is what opens a trick. A separate open-a-trick call would create a state nobody asked for &mdash;
 * an open trick with no plays in it &mdash; and would need its own authorisation and its own
 * refusals for no gain.
 *
 * <p>Authorisation is the first <em>port call</em> of {@link #execute}, before any read of the hands
 * and before any write; only a null check on the command and the read of its session identifier
 * precede it, and neither touches a port or the table's state. Neither {@link HandRepository} nor
 * {@link TrickRepository} takes an acting
 * player, so this is the only place it can happen, and the refusals below it are informative enough
 * to describe the table's state to whoever asks (ADR-024). The acting seat is then taken from the
 * resolved player and nowhere else: {@link PlayCardCommand} cannot carry one.
 *
 * <p>The card is looked up twice, deliberately, against two independent authorities. The deck row
 * supplies the suit and rank, so a caller cannot assert them; the hand is then asked to resolve that
 * card, so a card the player does not hold is refused whatever the deck says about it. Both lookups
 * have to agree before anything is written.
 *
 * <p>The second of those lookups is run once here, before {@link TrickRepository#openTrick}, and then
 * again inside {@link Trick#acceptPlay} which remains the sole authority on legality. The
 * duplication buys ordering, not safety: opening commits a row, and if the play were refused
 * afterwards the session would be left holding an open trick that nobody can play into.
 *
 * <p>A hand that has been played out is refused before any of that, by name. Every hand is empty
 * once the last trick is resolved, and each of the three checks below it would otherwise answer the
 * same state with something untrue: {@link org.maglez.eop.entity.Hand#resolve} reports a card the
 * player does not hold, which is a 422 saying the caller named the wrong card when there is no card
 * left to name; {@link HandRepository#findCurrentLeaderSeat} finds no leader recorded and cannot tell
 * a spent hand from an undealt one; and {@link Trick#assertSeatMayPlay} answers a trick opened on a
 * seat holding no cards with an {@link IllegalStateException}, a 500 for an ordinary end of play.
 * {@link HandCompleteException} is checked here so the honest answer arrives first, and it is checked
 * after the seat, because who the caller is settles before what the table is doing.
 *
 * <p>Turn order is pre-flighted for the same reason, and it has to be a separate check: a player who
 * genuinely holds the card but is not the one to lead passes the resolve above, so without this guard
 * {@link TrickRepository#openTrick} would commit a trick row and only then would
 * {@link Trick#acceptPlay} refuse the play &mdash; leaving behind an open, empty trick nobody asked
 * for and whose leader seat is not the refused caller's. On the opening path the seat to play is by
 * definition the recorded leader seat, so comparing the two is exact rather than approximate.
 * {@link Trick#acceptPlay} still re-checks it, and still owns the answer once a trick is under way,
 * where whose turn it is depends on the plays already made rather than on the leader alone.
 *
 * <p>For the same reason the candidate play is built before {@link TrickRepository#openTrick} is
 * called rather than after it. {@link TrickPlay} is where the bounds on caller supplied text live
 * &mdash; at most twenty components, two hundred characters each, two thousand characters of notes,
 * and no control or bidirectional formatting characters &mdash; and {@link PlayCardCommand}
 * deliberately does not repeat them, because one place that enforces an invariant is easier to trust
 * than two that have to agree. Opening the trick first would commit a row and only then reject an
 * over-long note, which is the same orphan trick the two guards above exist to prevent arriving by a
 * different door. Building the play first is what makes every refusal on an opening lead precede the
 * write, rather than only the two that were thought of first.
 *
 * <p>The leader seat handed to every write comes from the trick that was read or from
 * {@link HandRepository#findCurrentLeaderSeat}, never from the caller. It is the compare-and-set
 * witness that serialises concurrent plays (ADR-020), and it advances once per trick rather than
 * once per play, so opening passes the same value it read. Whose turn it is <em>within</em> a trick
 * is derived by {@link Trick} from the plays already made.
 *
 * <p>What is persisted is the play as {@link Trick#acceptPlay} returned it, carrying the card as
 * dealt rather than as claimed. The updated trick is returned because a played card is face up on
 * the table; nothing in it is private.
 *
 * <p>Once the play is appended, {@code card-played} is announced through
 * {@link SessionEventPublisher}. The announcement is made after the write returns, so a refused play
 * announces nothing, and it carries no part of the play: {@link SessionEvent} names a type, a session
 * and an instant, leaving every recipient to re-read the state of play for itself (ADR-014). That is
 * what keeps one producer of the answer rather than two that can disagree, and it is also why the
 * caller is told whose turn it is by that read rather than by this response. Publishing is not
 * guarded here because it must not fail a request &mdash; an obligation
 * {@link SessionEventPublisher} places on its implementation &mdash; and delivery is unordered with
 * respect to this response, so a caller may be notified of its own play.
 *
 * <p>When the play just appended completes the trick &mdash; every seat that holds cards has now
 * played &mdash; the trick is resolved inline before this method returns. The winner is determined,
 * the resolution is recorded, and {@code trick-resolved} is published immediately after
 * {@code card-played}. If no seat holds cards after the resolution the session is marked completed
 * and {@code game-completed} follows. This keeps the UI simple: it reacts to {@code trick-resolved}
 * without needing to call a separate resolve endpoint, and there is no window in which the trick is
 * complete but unresolved. {@link ResolveTrickUseCase} remains available for reconnect and edge
 * cases; it will return {@link org.maglez.eop.entity.TrickAlreadyResolvedException} if called on a
 * trick this path already resolved.
 *
 * <p>Every sentence above about what is written and what is announced is carried out by
 * {@link TrickJournal}, not here. Until EOP-190 this class held {@code TrickRepository},
 * {@code SessionRepository}, {@link SessionEventPublisher} and the optional
 * {@link PersistGameResultUseCase} itself, and the resolution cascade &mdash; record, announce,
 * complete the session, persist the result, announce the game over &mdash; was written out inline
 * here and again in {@link ResolveTrickUseCase}. Both paths now reach it through the same journal, so
 * the two cannot drift apart, and the write-then-announce ordering this paragraph relies on is
 * enforced in one place rather than asserted in two.

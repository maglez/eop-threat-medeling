/**
 * Port through which the application reads and writes game sessions.
 *
 * <p>The read methods return a fully reconstituted aggregate built from database
 * rows and from nothing else. No in-memory registry, cache or subscriber list
 * contributes to the answer, which is what makes a reconnect after a deployment
 * indistinguishable from a first request (ADR-014).
 *
 * <p>The write methods are deliberately narrow rather than a single {@code save}.
 * Each one is a single transaction and each one is <em>conditional on the state
 * the caller observed</em>: a write that would apply to a session someone else has
 * already moved on is rejected rather than silently applied. That is a
 * compare-and-swap, not a duplicated business rule — the rules themselves live in
 * {@link GameSession}, which the caller has already consulted before arriving
 * here. Without the condition there is a window in which a join lands after play
 * has started, producing a seated player that the deal never saw.

/**
 * Sweeps expired sessions out of the database.
 *
 * <p>A session is expired when its {@code expires_at} timestamp is before the
 * current instant. The sweep transitions each such session to
 * {@link org.maglez.eop.entity.SessionStatus#ABANDONED} and then deletes it;
 * the {@code ON DELETE CASCADE} on {@code fk_player_game_session} removes the
 * player rows automatically.
 *
 * <p>This use case is the policy layer for the sweep. The scheduling trigger
 * lives in the adapter layer ({@code adapter/scheduling/}), which calls
 * {@link #execute()} on the configured interval.
 *
 * <p>The sweep is not a real-time revocation mechanism —
 * {@link ResolvePlayerUseCase} is the real-time guard. The sweep is a
 * housekeeping operation that removes rows that are already unreachable.

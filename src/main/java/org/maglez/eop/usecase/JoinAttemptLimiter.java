 * Port through which join attempts are rate limited.

 * much of the keyspace a blind search must cover; this limiter bounds how fast any
 * one address may cover it. Neither is sufficient alone, so removing this would be a
 * security regression rather than a simplification, and lengthening the code did not
 * make it optional (ADR-019).
 *
 * <p>Only failed attempts are counted. A facilitator sharing one code with five
 * players produces five successful joins from five addresses and must not be
 * throttled, while an attacker walking the keyspace produces nothing but misses.
 * Counting successes as well would punish the expected workflow and reward the
 * attacker with a cheaper signal.
 *
 * <p>Implementations are consulted before any lookup happens, so a refusal costs
 * no database work.

 * aggregate is fully formed before it is handed to a repository. A generator
 * attached to the JPA identifier would assign the value at flush time, which
 * would force a transient state in which the domain object exists without an
 * identity — and the domain types reject that, deliberately.
 *
 * <p>The implementation produces UUID version 7 values, which are ordered by
 * creation time. See ADR-018 for why version 7 rather than version 4, and for
 * the honest assessment that the ordering benefit is about readability of a
 * database dump rather than about performance at this scale.

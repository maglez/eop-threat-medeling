/**
 * Signals that a caller has made too many failed join attempts to be allowed
 * another one yet.
 *
 * <p>This exception lives in the application layer rather than beside the domain
 * exceptions, because being rate limited is not a violation of a rule of the game.
 * Nothing about a session is wrong; the request is simply refused for now.
 *
 * <p>It carries a retry delay so that the caller can be told when to come back,
 * and carries nothing else. In particular it does not carry the code that was
 * attempted: repeating a guess back to the guesser, or into a log, is how a
 * limiter turns into an oracle.
 *
 * <p>A plain Java exception with no Spring imports, per ADR-005. The application
 * layer does not know that HTTP exists, so it does not know that this becomes 429.

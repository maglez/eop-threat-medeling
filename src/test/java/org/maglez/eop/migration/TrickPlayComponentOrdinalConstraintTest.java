/**
 * Pins the CHECK constraint in 004-trick-play-schema.xml to {@link TrickPlay#MAX_COMPONENTS}.
 *
 * <p>Changeset 006 hard-codes {@code CHECK (ordinal >= 0 AND ordinal <= 19)}.
 * Liquibase cannot read a Java constant, so if {@code MAX_COMPONENTS} is ever raised
 * the storage constraint becomes stricter than the domain: a legal play with ordinal 20
 * would be rejected by the database with a 500, not by the domain with a 400.
 *
 * <p>ADR-023 explicitly requires this test. The approach — reading the changeset XML
 * off the classpath and extracting the bounds — is the same pattern used by
 * {@code AdrIndexConsistencyTest}: a resource file is read from a test to hold docs
 * and code together without touching production sources.
 *
 * <p>Two properties of the match are load-bearing, and both were defects in the first
 * version of this test.
 *
 * <p>First, <strong>both</strong> bounds are pinned. Pinning only {@code <= 19} left
 * {@code >= 0} guarded by nothing: deleting that conjunct would widen the ordinal domain
 * to every negative int, which destroys the pigeonhole argument that caps a play at 20
 * component rows, while every test stayed green.
 *
 * <p>Second, the pattern is anchored to the whole {@code ADD CONSTRAINT ... CHECK (...)}
 * statement and the test asserts it appears <strong>exactly once</strong> in the file.
 * A bare {@code ordinal <= (\d+)} pattern taking the first match was demonstrably
 * defeatable: an explanatory comment mentioning the old bound above the {@code <sql>}
 * block became the pinned value, so the test reported success while the deployed
 * constraint said something else. Prose cannot satisfy this pattern without reproducing
 * the entire DDL statement verbatim, and if it does the match count catches it.
 *
 * <p>No Spring context. No I/O beyond a single classpath resource read.

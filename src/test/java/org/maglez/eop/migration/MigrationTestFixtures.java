/**
 * Shared FK-chain builders for migration tests that need to insert rows into
 * {@code trick_play} or {@code trick_play_component}.
 *
 * <p>The full FK chain required to insert a {@code trick_play} row is:
 * <pre>
 *   game_session  ← player ← trick_play
 *   game_session  ← trick  ← trick_play
 *   card          ← trick_play
 * </pre>
 * Satisfying this chain requires inserting rows into {@code game_session}, {@code player},
 * {@code card}, and {@code trick} before the play row can be attempted.  That is non-trivial
 * but not disproportionate: the constraints being tested are database-level enforcements, and
 * a test that bypasses the FK chain would be testing a different (weaker) schema than the
 * one that ships.
 *
 * <p>The {@code player} link is the newest of these and the reason this class changed:
 * until {@code fk_trick_play_player_seat} and {@code fk_hand_player_seat} were added
 * (changeset 009, replacing the former single-column {@code fk_trick_play_player} and
 * {@code fk_hand_player}), these fixtures passed a bare {@code UUID.randomUUID()} as
 * {@code player_id}.  That was not merely a shortcut — it meant every constraint test in
 * this package was passing while simultaneously demonstrating that a play could be written
 * by a player who exists in no session at all.  Real {@code player} rows are now inserted,
 * so the fixtures can no longer certify the gap they were written on top of.
 *
 * <p>The composite foreign keys also bind {@code seat_order}: a play or hand whose
 * {@code seat_order} disagrees with the player's own {@code player.seat_order} is rejected
 * by the engine.  {@link #insertTrickPlay} takes seat and player independently, so a caller
 * can construct a seat-inconsistent row without noticing — this is intentional, because the
 * negative tests in {@code TrickPlayForeignKeyTest} need to do exactly that.  Callers that
 * want a valid row should use {@link #insertMinimalTrickPlay} or
 * {@link #insertSeatConsistentTrickPlay}, which create the player and the play at one agreed
 * seat and cannot produce a mismatch.
 *
 * <p>All methods are package-private static utilities.  No Spring context.

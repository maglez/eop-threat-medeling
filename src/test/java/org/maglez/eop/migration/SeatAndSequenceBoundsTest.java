/**
 * Proves the three range CHECK constraints added by
 * {@code 005-seat-and-sequence-bounds.xml} are enforced by the database engine.
 *
 * <p>This class exists because of a measurement, not a hypothesis. While reviewing Slice B,
 * @security-auditor inserted {@code player.seat_order = -7}, {@code trick.sequence = -5} and
 * {@code game_session.current_leader_seat = 9999} against the merged schema and the engine
 * <strong>accepted all three</strong>, while the domain refuses all three
 * ({@link GameSession#MAXIMUM_PLAYERS} caps the table at six seats; {@code Trick} and
 * {@code TrickPlay} reject seats outside 0..5). ADR-023:1180-1206 records that gap and
 * assigns it to Slice C. The three tests below re-run those exact three inserts and assert
 * they now fail, so the fix has evidence attached rather than an assertion in a changeset
 * comment.
 *
 * <p><strong>Every constraint is tested in both directions, and that is the point.</strong>
 * A test that only proves rejection would pass just as happily against a CHECK that rejected
 * every value, including legal ones — it would certify a schema that cannot seat a player at
 * all. So each constraint gets a companion test inserting the boundary values that must
 * still be accepted: seats 0 and 5, sequence 1, and {@code NULL} plus 0 and 5 for
 * {@code current_leader_seat}. The rejection tests are meaningful only because the
 * acceptance tests sit beside them.
 *
 * <p>The bounds are also pinned to the domain constant by
 * {@link #checkConstraintsArePinnedToMaximumPlayers()}, following the precedent set by
 * {@code TrickPlayComponentOrdinalConstraintTest}. Liquibase cannot read a Java constant, so
 * the literal {@code 5} in the changeset is a hand-copied counterpart of
 * {@code MAXIMUM_PLAYERS - 1} and carries the asymmetric-drift risk that changeset 006
 * documented for the ordinal bound: raising {@code MAXIMUM_PLAYERS} to seat a seventh player
 * would leave storage stricter than the domain, turning a legal join into a 500 rather than
 * a validation error. The pinning test fails loudly instead.
 *
 * <p>SQL state {@code 23513} is H2's CHECK-constraint violation code, and it is asserted
 * rather than merely catching {@link SQLException} because the inserts in these tests can
 * fail for other reasons — a unique violation on {@code uq_player_session_seat} is
 * {@code 23505} and a missing parent row is {@code 23506}, and either would let a test pass
 * without the CHECK existing. This mirrors the reasoning in
 * {@code TrickPlayComponentCheckConstraintTest:41-61}. Note that PostgreSQL 17 reports
 * {@code 23514} for the same violation; the state is asserted here only because the suite
 * runs on H2, and the code that translates these violations into HTTP statuses must accept
 * both.
 *
 * <p>No Spring context. Owns its own uniquely-named in-memory H2 database.
 * {@code connection.setAutoCommit(true)} is set immediately after Liquibase runs, because
 * Liquibase leaves auto-commit off and uncommitted parent rows would make these inserts fail
 * on a foreign key rather than on the CHECK under test.

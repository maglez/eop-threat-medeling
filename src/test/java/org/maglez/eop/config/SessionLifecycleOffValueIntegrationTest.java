/**
 * Asserts that {@code eop.features.session-lifecycle=off} withholds the lobby rather than enabling it.
 *
 * <p>This class exists because until EOP-48 it would have failed. The condition on
 * {@link SessionController} named the property without naming the value it wanted, and
 * {@link org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.condition.ConditionalOnProperty} in that form matches
 * any value present that is not literally {@code false}. So {@code off} — along with {@code no},
 * {@code 0} and {@code disabled} — switched the five session routes <em>on</em>. The flag was
 * fail-open, against the plain requirement in {@code .opencode/rules/security.md} that a control
 * fails securely, and ADR-013 now requires {@code havingValue = "true"} on every flag in the
 * repository so that a flag's off position is every value except one rather than one value except
 * everything.
 *
 * <p>{@code off} is the spelling worth pinning down, of the several that used to fail open. It is the
 * word an operator reaches for when they want a kill switch, and in YAML 1.1 it is a boolean false,
 * so a hand-edited {@code application.yml} reading {@code session-lifecycle: off} looks correct to
 * every reader and to the YAML specification while enabling the feature. A regression here would be
 * invisible at review.
 *
 * <p>The sibling {@code SessionControllerDisabledIntegrationTest} covers the same flag spelled
 * {@code false}, and it is left exactly as it was. It passed before this fix and after it, which is
 * the point: the literal spelling was never the broken one, so a test using it could not have caught
 * this, and only a second spelling proves the difference. The two classes cost two Spring contexts
 * because the property override is part of the context cache key, and that is the price of testing
 * the flag rather than trusting it.
 *
 * <p>Bean absence is asserted as well as the 404s, and the pair is not redundant. A 404 alone would
 * also be produced by a controller that existed with its handlers mapped elsewhere, which is a design
 * ADR-013 forbids and — more to the point here — is close to what the fail-open version actually did:
 * the routes were live, so a status-only test would have been the one thing that could not tell the
 * bug from the fix. The four use-case beans are checked for the same reason at one layer down. They
 * were registered unconditionally before EOP-48, so the beans that open and mutate a session existed
 * whatever the flag said and only the route was ever withheld; gating them is what makes the off
 * position a property of the context.
 *
 * <p>That reasoning was measured rather than assumed. Running this class against the pre-EOP-48
 * production code failed six of its twelve tests: the five bean assertions, and exactly one of the
 * five route assertions — {@code POST /api/v1/sessions} answered <strong>201 Created</strong> with the
 * flag set to {@code off}, persisting a session. The other four routes returned 404 anyway, because a
 * random session identifier and an unissued join code are absent whether or not the controller is,
 * so those four statuses are identical for the bug and for the fix. A status-only test would
 * therefore have caught this on one route out of five and only because that route creates something;
 * had the lobby been read-only it would have caught nothing at all.
 *
 * <p>The last two tests are the counterweight, and the first of them is load-bearing rather than
 * decorative. {@link ResolvePlayerUseCase} is ungated on purpose: it writes nothing, and the
 * trick-play use cases depend on it too. This context is precisely the combination that would expose
 * a mistake there — the lobby flag off while trick play is on, as the suite leaves it — so if
 * resolve-player were ever gated on the lobby flag, trick play would become unsatisfiable and this
 * context would fail to start rather than fail an assertion.

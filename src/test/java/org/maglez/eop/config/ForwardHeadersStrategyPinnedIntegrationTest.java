/**
 * Pins {@code server.forward-headers-strategy=none} and proves it is load-bearing (EOP-26).
 *
 * <p>With {@code NATIVE}, Tomcat's {@code RemoteIpValve} default {@code internalProxies}
 * includes {@code 172.16.0.0/12} — which contains this project's own {@code 172.28.0.0/24}
 * Compose subnet — and {@code 127.0.0.0/8}, which covers local {@code ./mvnw spring-boot:run}.
 * With {@code FRAMEWORK}, Spring's {@code ForwardedHeaderFilter} overrides
 * {@code getRemoteAddr()} with no trust check at all. Either alternative would launder
 * {@code X-Forwarded-For} into the one input {@link org.maglez.eop.adapter.web.ClientAddressResolver}
 * trusts, silently re-opening EOP-26 without any test failing.
 *
 * <p>Two assertions are made here, and the reasoning for each is worth stating:
 *
 * <p><strong>Property assertion</strong> ({@link #shouldPinForwardHeadersStrategyToNone()}):
 * asserts the bound {@link ServerProperties} value is {@code NONE}. This is the cheapest
 * possible gate — it fires the moment the property is deleted or changed, before any
 * behavioural consequence is visible. It is a property-string assertion, which is weaker
 * than a behavioural one, but it is also the earliest possible signal.
 *
 * <p><strong>Behavioural assertion</strong>
 * ({@link #shouldNotHonourForwardedForHeaderWithoutTrustedProxy()}): sends a join request
 * with {@code X-Forwarded-For: 198.51.100.1} from the MockMvc peer ({@code 127.0.0.1}).
 * With {@code NATIVE} or {@code FRAMEWORK}, the container or filter would rewrite
 * {@code getRemoteAddr()} to {@code 198.51.100.1} before {@code ClientAddressResolver}
 * sees it. Because no trusted proxy is configured, the resolver would then use the peer
 * address directly — but if the container already rewrote it, the peer address is now the
 * forwarded value, not the real one. The test saturates the bucket for {@code 198.51.100.1}
 * and then asserts that a second distinct address ({@code 198.51.100.2}) is also throttled
 * after ten failures — which can only happen if both addresses collapsed into the same
 * real peer bucket ({@code 127.0.0.1}), proving the header was ignored. If the strategy
 * were {@code NATIVE} or {@code FRAMEWORK}, the two addresses would produce independent
 * buckets and the second address would not be throttled, failing the assertion.
 * An observable-behaviour assertion is worth more than a property-string assertion because
 * it catches the failure mode rather than just the configuration change that causes it.

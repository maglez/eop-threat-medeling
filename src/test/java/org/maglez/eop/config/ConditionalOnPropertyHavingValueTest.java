/**
 * Enforces ADR-052: every {@code @ConditionalOnProperty} in main source carries {@code havingValue = "true"}.
 *
 * <p>ADR-013 mandates the tight form, and the reason is a fail-open reduction in Spring's own condition
 * evaluator. When {@code havingValue} is left empty, {@code OnPropertyCondition$Spec.isMatch} in the pinned
 * {@code spring-boot-autoconfigure} 4.1.0 reduces to {@code !"false".equalsIgnoreCase(value)}. The loose form
 * therefore <strong>enables</strong> the gated feature for every present value except the literal
 * {@code false} — including {@code off}, {@code no}, {@code 0}, {@code disabled}, and the empty string that
 * {@code EOP_FEATURES_SOMETHING=} exported empty produces. {@code off} is the worst of them: it is both the
 * spelling an operator reaches for as a kill switch and a YAML 1.1 boolean false, so it reads "disabled" to a
 * human and "enabled" to Spring. Note that {@code matchIfMissing} already defaults to {@code false}, so an
 * <em>absent</em> property was never the hole <em>in the loose form</em> — that hole is confined to
 * present-but-not-{@code false}.
 *
 * <p>{@code matchIfMissing} is audited here too, as a second and independent invariant, because it reaches the
 * same fail-open shape through a different attribute. A site written {@code havingValue = "true",
 * matchIfMissing = true} satisfies the ADR-013 mandate to the letter while enabling the feature when the
 * property is <em>absent</em> — the exact inverse of the fail-closed default {@code feature-flags.md} mandates
 * ("an unset flag reads as disabled, so forgetting to think about one fails closed"). It is in one respect
 * worse than the loose {@code havingValue} it would sit beside, because it needs no operator mistake at all to
 * fire: shipping the annotation is sufficient. No site sets it today, so this half of the gate is preventive in
 * the same way the first half is. It was added during EOP-50's own review round, on the finding that a gate
 * checking only {@code havingValue} would have admitted a configuration defeating that gate's own purpose.
 *
 * <p>The reason that mandate needs a test rather than only a rule and an ADR is that prose was tried and
 * demonstrably did not hold. ADR-013 already required the tight form when it was violated <em>twice, in two
 * independent commits</em>: {@code TrickController} (fixed in {@code 56c31b1}, EOP-14 slice D) and
 * {@code SessionController} plus four unconditional use-case beans (fixed in {@code 34d30d7} and
 * {@code 50850d1}, EOP-48). Both were caught by a reviewer rather than by the build, which is the failure this
 * class removes. Every site complies as of EOP-50, so this gate is <em>preventive</em>: it exists to stop the
 * third recurrence, not to fix a present defect.
 *
 * <p>The assertions read <strong>compiled bytecode</strong> rather than Java source text, which buys two
 * properties that a {@code docs}-style textual guard could not have. Source formatting cannot defeat them: a
 * multi-line annotation, an unusual attribute order, an interleaved comment and a line wrap are all invisible
 * at this level. And annotation <em>defaults are applied by the reader</em>, so an omitted {@code havingValue}
 * arrives as the empty string and is rejected by a positive comparison against {@code "true"} — this guard
 * proves a value is correct rather than proving a piece of text is absent, which is the weaker formulation
 * that {@code build-quality.md} warns about for the prose gates. That is also why this class lives in
 * {@code config} and not in {@code docs}: it asserts a property of compiled code, not of prose.
 *
 * <p>Scope is deliberately <em>every</em> {@code @ConditionalOnProperty} under {@code org.maglez.eop}, not only
 * those naming an {@code eop.features.*} key. Infrastructure toggles default closed for the same fail-open
 * reason a feature flag does — {@code caching.md} notes it "matters more here than elsewhere" for a cache
 * switch sitting in front of security-sensitive reads — so a future non-flag conditional is correctly in
 * scope. If a genuine need for a non-{@code "true"} {@code havingValue} ever arises, amend ADR-052 and add a
 * narrowly justified allow-list under review. Do not weaken the comparison to accommodate one call site.
 *
 * <p>What this class deliberately does <strong>not</strong> check is the second half of the ADR-013 mandate:
 * that a flag be repeated on every bean which opens or mutates the flagged state, rather than on the
 * controller alone. That clause is not mechanically checkable and ADR-052 says so openly. "Opens or mutates
 * the flagged state" is a semantic judgement about domain behaviour that no annotation or type signature
 * encodes, the rule's own carve-outs for pure reads and for collaborators shared with a second flag are
 * justified in javadoc prose that is unparseable as intent, and mechanising it would require a hand-maintained
 * register of which beans belong to which flag — recreating precisely the drift-prone second register that
 * EOP-48's security analysis rejected. So the first clause is machine-enforced here and the second remains
 * reviewer-enforced, an asymmetry worth knowing before citing this test as proof the whole mandate is
 * automated.

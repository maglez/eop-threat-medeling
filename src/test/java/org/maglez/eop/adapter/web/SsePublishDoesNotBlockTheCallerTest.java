/**
 * Pins the fix for EOP-223: one subscriber that has stopped reading its socket
 * must not delay the request that published the event.
 *
 * <p>The reported symptom was a join POST hanging for tens of seconds with no
 * server-side log line at all, only ever with several browsers attached to one
 * session. The cause was that the fan-out wrote to every subscriber's socket
 * serially on the publishing request's own thread. A peer that has departed
 * makes that write throw, which the class always handled; a peer that is still
 * connected but has stopped draining its socket -- a page mid-reload, a browser
 * context being torn down -- makes it <em>block</em> instead, which nothing
 * handled and nothing logged.
 *
 * <p>Reproducing that needs an emitter whose write blocks, which no real
 * subscriber can be talked into doing on demand, so the publisher's emitter
 * factory is overridden here. The blocking emitter lets its first write through,
 * because that one is {@code subscribe}'s own "subscribed" frame and is issued
 * before the test has anything to observe.
 *
 * <p>The heartbeat is parked an hour away deliberately. It shares the send pool
 * with publishing, so a fifty-millisecond sweep would keep handing the stalled
 * emitter fresh writes and occupy the pool with them, which is a genuine
 * capacity characteristic but not the thing under test here.

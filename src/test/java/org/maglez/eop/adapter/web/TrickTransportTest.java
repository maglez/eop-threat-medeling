/**
 * Exercises the transport objects the trick-play routes publish.
 *
 * <p>Several assertions here are about what the wire does <em>not</em> carry, and every one of them is
 * asserted against real serialised JSON rather than against the record's components. A record component that
 * is null is not the same thing as an absent field: the difference is a Jackson setting, the setting
 * is on these two classes rather than on the application, and a client distinguishing a resolved
 * trick from an unresolved one by the presence of {@code winningSeat} is relying on it. Asserting the
 * component is null would pass just as well against {@code "winningSeat": null}, which would tell
 * that client the wrong thing.
 *
 * <p>The most important assertion is that mapping an unresolved trick does not throw.
 * {@link Trick#winningSeat()} refuses to answer before resolution, so the mapping asks
 * {@link Trick#winner()} instead and lets an absent winner mean an absent field. That is easy to
 * "simplify" into a direct call, and the failure would be a 500 on the ordinary response to every
 * play but the last of a trick.
 *
 * <p>The state of play is published by a separate record from the trick itself, and the reason is
 * asserted here rather than only argued in a comment: three of its five fields are absent at ordinary
 * moments, and the two seat answers it carries come from different authorities — the cards on the table
 * and the seat the session row records as leading. Nothing reconciles them on the way out, so a state
 * holding two different seats is published as two different seats. A mapping that quietly preferred one
 * would take away the only check a client has on either.

 *
 * <p>A join code is about thirty bits. That is unguessable only while guessing is
 * slow, so an off-by-one that allowed a hundred attempts a minute instead of ten
 * would not break a single feature and would not be noticed — it would simply move
 * the expected time to stumble onto a live session from centuries to weeks. Every
 * test here pins a number that a reviewer would otherwise have to take on trust.
 *
 * <p>Time is injected rather than waited for. A test that slept for a minute to

/**
 * End-to-end proof that rotating {@code X-Forwarded-For} does not reset the join
 * throttle when the peer is not a trusted proxy.
 *
 * <p>Before EOP-26 the header was read unconditionally, so a caller could supply
 * a different value on every request and be handed a fresh, empty bucket each time.
 * With ten failures allowed per address per minute, and a join code of forty bits,
 * an attacker who rotated the header could make unlimited guesses from a single
 * machine, working through the keyspace at a rate the limiter exists to deny.
 * ADR-019 treats the throttle as a security control that the code's length bounds
 * but does not replace, so this is not defence in depth — it is the control itself.
 *
 * <p>The test drives more than {@code MAX_FAILURES_PER_ADDRESS} failing join
 * attempts while rotating the header on every request. If the fix is absent the
 * throttle never fires; if it is present the eleventh attempt is refused with
 * HTTP 429. Each attempt uses a distinct join code so the per-code counter cannot
 * be what triggers the refusal — only the per-address counter can.
 *
 * <p>The mirror-image case uses {@code @SpringBootTest(properties)} to configure
 * {@code 127.0.0.1/32} as a trusted proxy. MockMvc's peer is always
 * {@code 127.0.0.1}, so the header is now believed, and rotating it produces
 * independent buckets — proving that the allow-list is actually consulted rather
 * than the header being ignored unconditionally.
 *
 * <p>Each nested class carries its own {@code @SpringBootTest} with a dedicated
 * in-memory database so it gets its own {@link InMemoryJoinAttemptLimiter} singleton,
 * isolated from the shared default context. {@code @DirtiesContext(AFTER_CLASS)} marks
 * each context dirty after the class finishes so it is not retained in the cache.

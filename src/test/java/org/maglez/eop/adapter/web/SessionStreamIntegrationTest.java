/**
 * Proves that a browser holding an open connection is actually told what happened.
 *
 * <p>Every other test of the realtime path stops at the publisher: it can show that an emitter was
 * registered, that a departed emitter was forgotten and that the heartbeat thread sweeps. None of
 * them can show that a byte ever left the process, because a {@code SseEmitter} with no servlet
 * behind it buffers what it is handed instead of writing it. This class starts a real server on a
 * real port, opens a real socket and reads the wire.
 *
 * <p>The client is the JDK's own {@code HttpClient} with a line body handler rather than an SSE
 * client library. That is deliberate twice over: the project does not depend on WebFlux, so
 * {@code WebClient} is not available; and a parsing SSE client would helpfully discard exactly the
 * frames this test exists to check. The reconnect hint and both comment frames carry no event and
 * no data, so a well-behaved parser drops them — yet they are the whole of the keep-alive contract
 * with an intermediary, and a proxy that idles a commentless connection out is the failure this
 * suite is meant to catch (ADR-014).
 *
 * <p>The heartbeat is turned down from fifteen seconds to two hundred milliseconds for this context
 * alone. A test that waited out the production interval would be the slowest in the suite by two
 * orders of magnitude and would tell us nothing extra.
 *
 * <p>One test here is not about the wire at all. {@code shouldNotHoldAJdbcConnectionForTheLifetimeOfAStream}
 * asserts that an open stream costs no JDBC connection, and it lives in this class because it needs
 * exactly what this class already provides: a real server, so that returning an {@code SseEmitter}
 * really does start async processing. With {@code spring.jpa.open-in-view} at Spring's default of
 * {@code true} the {@code EntityManager} opened to validate the player token stayed bound until the
 * request completed — which for a stream means until the stream ended — so each watcher held one of
 * the pool's ten connections and a handful of watchers stalled every database-backed request in the
 * application for as long as it took a heartbeat to reap a dead stream (EOP-227, ADR-070).

/**
 * Unit tests for {@link SecureRandomIdentityTokenGenerator}.
 *
 * <p>An identity token is the only credential distinguishing one player from another, and a
 * player from the facilitator, so predicting one is impersonation and in the facilitator's case
 * privilege escalation. As with the join code generator alongside it, the property that matters
 * most — unpredictability — is the one no behavioural assertion can observe: a generator seeded
 * from {@code java.util.Random} emits tokens of the right length, in the right alphabet, that
 * decode to the right number of bytes and never repeat. It passes every test below except the
 * last, which reads the source text instead. The pattern comes from
 * {@code IdentityTokenHashTest.shouldCompareInConstantTime}.
 *
 * <p>The length and decoded-size assertions are the two halves of one property and are worth
 * keeping separate. Base64url over 32 bytes without padding is 43 characters, since 32 bytes is
 * 256 bits and 256 divided by 6 rounds up to 43; asserting the character length pins the wire
 * format callers see, while decoding and counting bytes pins the entropy behind it. A generator
 * quietly reduced to 16 bytes would still emit a plausible-looking token, and only the second
 * assertion notices.
 *
 * <p>The no-repeat assertion is probabilistic and safe by an enormous margin: over a thousand
 * draws from a 2<sup>256</sup> space the birthday bound is around 10<sup>-71</sup>. It is not
 * testing a uniqueness guarantee the generator makes — it fails for a generator that has
 * collapsed onto a constant, which every other assertion here would pass.

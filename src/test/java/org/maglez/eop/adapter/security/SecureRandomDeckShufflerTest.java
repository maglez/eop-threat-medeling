/**
 * Measures the one property of a shuffle that only the real implementation can be held to.
 *
 * <p>Every use case above this class is tested against a deterministic stand-in, because a
 * predictable permutation is what makes a deal assertable. That leaves exactly one thing
 * unmeasured, and it is measured here: that this implementation returns a genuine permutation of
 * what it was given, keeps its hands off the caller's list, and does not hand the deck back in the
 * order it arrived.
 *
 * <p>The assertion that the order changes is the only probabilistic one in the suite. A shuffle of
 * the seventy-eight card deck has 78! possible outcomes, so the chance of two independent shuffles
 * agreeing with each other by luck is far smaller than the chance of the machine running this test
 * failing mid-run. The assertion is written over two shuffles rather than one so that it fails for
 * the defect it is aimed at — an implementation that forgot to shuffle at all, or that shuffled a
 * copy and returned the original — rather than merely for an unlucky draw.
 *
 * <p>Preserving the caller's list matters more than it looks. The deck arrives from
 * {@code CardRepository.findWholeDeck()}, which builds it from an immutable {@code List.copyOf},
 * and a future caching adapter could hand out the same instance to every table. An implementation
 * that shuffled in place would either throw on the immutable list or, worse, reorder a shared deck
 * under every other session at once.

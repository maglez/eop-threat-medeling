/**
 * Unit tests for {@link SecureRandomJoinCodeGenerator}.
 *
 * <p>A join code is the only gate on entering a session, so the property that matters most
 * here — that the draw is unpredictable — is the one property no behavioural assertion can
 * reach. A generator seeded from {@code java.util.Random} produces codes of the right length,
 * drawn from the right alphabet, that never repeat across a thousand draws; it satisfies every
 * test below except the last one. That is why the last one reads the source text. The pattern
 * is borrowed from {@code IdentityTokenHashTest.shouldCompareInConstantTime}, which pins a
 * constant-time comparison for the same reason: the defect it guards against is invisible from
 * outside the class.
 *
 * <p>Two of the assertions are probabilistic and both are safe by a wide margin. Across a
 * thousand draws from the 32<sup>8</sup> (about 1.1 x 10<sup>12</sup>) keyspace, the birthday
 * bound puts the chance of a coincidental repeat at roughly 4.5 x 10<sup>-7</sup> — orders of
 * magnitude below the chance of the machine running the test failing mid-run. The chance of a
 * particular alphabet symbol being absent from the eight thousand characters those draws
 * produce is (31/32)<sup>8000</sup>, which is far smaller still. Both are written over enough
 * draws to fail for the defects they are aimed at — a generator collapsed onto a constant, and
 * an off-by-one bound that leaves the last symbol unreachable — rather than for bad luck.

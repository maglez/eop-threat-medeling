/**
 * Pins the two seat guards in {@link TrickPlayRepositoryAdapter}.
 *
 * <p>Between them these guards have three limbs an integration test cannot reach, and
 * the reason differs by limb rather than being one reason repeated. {@code seatRead} is
 * unreachable in both directions: it exists to survive a row that {@code
 * chk_game_session_current_leader_seat} now refuses, so the row cannot be manufactured
 * at all, and proving it through the adapter would mean dropping the constraint and
 * measuring the guard against a schema the application never runs on. {@code
 * seatToWrite} is different: its overflow limb <em>is</em> proved through the adapter,
 * by {@code refusesAnOpeningLeaderSeatOutOfRange}, and only its negative limb is out of
 * reach — not because of a constraint, but because every production caller hands it a
 * seat a domain object has already bounded below zero.
 *
 * <p>So they are proved here instead, as the pure functions they are: no Spring, no
 * database, sub-millisecond. What this cannot prove is the translation the adapter
 * applies on the way out — that an {@link IllegalStateException} leaving a {@code
 * @Repository} reaches the catch-all 500 rather than the handler that answers 400. That
 * half is pinned by {@code TrickPlayRepositoryAdapterIntegrationTest}, which asserts it
 * on the sibling paths that do throw {@link IllegalStateException} through a real
 * context.
 *
 * <p>The table below is written twice over, deliberately. The parameterised cases use
 * literal seats, because a table of literals is what makes a reader see which values are
 * being claimed legal; the four boundary cases are derived from {@link
 * GameSession#MAXIMUM_PLAYERS} instead, so the real limit and the first value past it
 * stay under test whatever that constant becomes. Changing the constant therefore turns
 * the literal cases red, which is the intended outcome: a table that quietly kept
 * passing would be a table that had stopped testing the bound.

/**
 * Proves that every mapped entity still agrees with the migrated schema.
 *
 * <p>This is the test that stops {@code ddl-auto: validate} from being free. Until
 * this slice, three tables were mapped and the five created by changeset {@code 004}
 * were not, so Hibernate validated nothing about them and a mistake in the schema
 * could only be found by a query that happened to touch it. Mapping them means
 * Hibernate now checks all eight tables, and every column and type on them, at every
 * context start — on H2 in this suite and on PostgreSQL in production.
 *
 * <p>That check is silent when it passes, which is exactly why it needs a test of its
 * own rather than being left as something the other integration tests get
 * incidentally. Two things could turn it off without any test going red:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code ddl-auto} being changed to {@code none} or {@code update}, either of
 *       which would let a mapping drift from the schema indefinitely. The first test
 *       here asserts the effective value, so that change fails loudly instead of
 *       quietly removing a guard.</li>
 *   <li>An entity being deleted or renamed. Validation only covers what is mapped, so
 *       an unmapped table passes startup with no complaint at all — which is the
 *       precise reason changeset {@code 004} refused to add a {@code resolved_at}
 *       column that nothing would map.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The second test goes further than startup does. Hibernate's validation compares
 * mappings against database metadata; this issues a real {@code SELECT} of every
 * mapped column of every entity against the migrated database. A column name that
 * validation somehow tolerated still fails here, and it fails naming the entity.
 *
 * <p>These are entity names, not table names: the query is JPQL. The mapping from one
 * to the other is what is under test, so writing table names here would test the
 * database against itself.

/**
 * The two {@code @IdClass} keys standing behind the composite primary keys {@code pk_hand_card} and
 * {@code pk_trick_play_component}.
 *
 * <p>These are the only hand-written {@code equals} and {@code hashCode} in the persistence adapter,
 * and they are load-bearing in a way that is easy to miss: JPA uses them for identity-map lookups
 * and so for deciding whether {@code saveAllAndFlush} inserts a row or merges one. A key that
 * reported two different rows equal would silently turn an insert into a merge and lose a component;
 * one that reported the same row unequal would attempt a duplicate insert and fail against the
 * primary key.
 *
 * <p>They are tested here rather than left to the integration tests because those reach the keys only
 * through Hibernate, which compares them reflectively — invisible to coverage — and, more to the
 * point, only ever compares keys that <em>agree</em>. Every branch that decides two keys are
 * <em>different</em> is therefore untaken by the suite that appears to exercise them, which is why
 * both classes measured zero branch coverage while the round trips were passing.
 *
 * <p>Both no-argument constructors are exercised too. They exist only because JPA requires them, and
 * a key in that state holds a null identifier, which is the one input {@link java.util.Objects#equals}
 * is here to absorb.

/**
 * Holds the {@code File.java:123} line citations scattered through {@code docs/} against the files they name.
 *
 * <p>Documentation in this repository cites source by line — {@code SessionController.java:63} — and nothing used to check one.
 * EOP-49 existed solely because seven such anchors had drifted onto javadoc {@code @throws} tags roughly forty lines above the
 * code they claimed to name, and EOP-49's own ticket body then carried replacement numbers that were themselves stale by
 * twenty-four lines because they had been derived arithmetically instead of re-read. This gate is the eighth text-comparison
 * guard under {@code src/test/java/org/maglez/eop/docs/} and closes that gap for the citations that opt in.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Three checks, two of them universal.</strong> Every citation this gate recognises must name a path that resolves
 * to a tracked file (or sit in {@link #EXTERNAL_CITATIONS}), and must name lines that exist in that file. Those two catch
 * renames, typos and citations into files that have since shrunk. They are cheap and they apply to all 163 citations, but on
 * their own they are close to vacuous: a line number that has drifted onto a different line of a file that is still long
 * enough passes both. The third check is where the real strength is, and it is <em>opt-in</em>: a citation written as</p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code `Trick.java:441` (anchor: `winningPlay`)}</pre>
 *
 * <p>additionally asserts that the literal text {@code winningPlay} occurs within the cited line range. That form makes the
 * citation self-verifying — the anchor is the {@code grep} that re-derives the number — which is the instinct EOP-41 and
 * EOP-49 both converged on, and it is the ticket's own preferred option ("require a quoted token that must appear at that
 * line").</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Why anchoring is opt-in rather than inferred.</strong> A prototype that inferred the anchor from nearby
 * backticked identifiers flagged 36 of the 67 citations it could infer for, and the noise was not tunable. Two causes are
 * fundamental. Generic tokens carry no signal — {@code true}, {@code throw} and {@code getId} occur all over a file. And the
 * ambiguity is irreducible: 58 citations in {@code docs/} deliberately point at javadoc or comments, which is the very same
 * position EOP-49's defects had drifted onto, so no automatic rule can separate "cites the comment on purpose" from "drifted
 * onto the comment". Requiring the author to state the anchor dissolves both, and makes the gate ratchet: adoption can only
 * ever add coverage, never a false failure.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Opt-in has a second, less obvious payoff:</strong> it lets documentation quote its own history truthfully. Some
 * citations here are deliberately stale, because the prose is narrating a past defect rather than pointing at today's code —
 * {@code ADR-013:198} preserves the line number EOP-70 falsified, and several blockquoted passages freeze text written months
 * ago. A gate that checked every citation semantically would have to either falsify those quotations or grow an opt-out
 * marker. Because an unanchored citation is checked only for resolvability and range, they pass untouched and no exclusion
 * rule for blockquotes or quoted spans is needed anywhere in this class.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Coverage limits, stated because they are not obvious.</strong></p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><em>Named citations only.</em> The gate recognises {@code Name.ext:123} and {@code Name.ext:123-456}. It deliberately
 *       does not recognise the bare continuation form {@code `:124`} that several ADRs use after naming a file once, for two
 *       reasons: that syntax is indistinguishable from a port number — {@code `:8080`}, {@code `:5173`} and {@code `:5371`}
 *       all appear in {@code docs/} — and its antecedent is not mechanically recoverable, because a list such as
 *       {@code ADR-013:184-185} names ten files before the next bare reference, so "the last file named" binds to the wrong
 *       one. Roughly 122 bare references therefore go unchecked. A claim worth protecting must be written in the named form.</li>
 *   <li><em>Presence, not position.</em> An anchor must occur somewhere inside the cited range, not on an exact line. A
 *       single-line citation is therefore exact, while a wide range is correspondingly weaker.</li>
 *   <li><em>No proof of truth.</em> Like every guard in this package, a green result says the specific things checked here are
 *       consistent. It does not say the surrounding prose is correct.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Both floors below exist for the reason ADR-006 records in its branch-coverage lesson: a guard that has quietly stopped
 * matching anything is worse than no guard, because it reads as protection. If this gate ever becomes unfireable, delete it
 * rather than leave it green.</p>
 *
 * <p>Paths are resolved relative to the project base directory, which is Surefire's working directory.</p>

/**
 * Holds the k6 threshold-count constant in {@code .github/workflows/ci.yml} in step with the
 * thresholds actually declared in {@code test/k6/config/options-ci.js}, and holds the workflow to
 * selecting the CI threshold profile at all.
 *
 * <p>The performance canary added by EOP-155 does not trust k6's exit code, because k6 exits 0
 * even when it could not write its metrics. Instead the workflow parses the exported summary and
 * counts the thresholds it reports, comparing that count against a hardcoded
 * {@code EXPECTED_THRESHOLD_COUNT}. That constant is what turns a silently truncated summary into
 * a loud failure -- and until 2026-09-04 it was coupled to {@code options-ci.js} by a comment and
 * nothing else, so adding or removing a threshold there would leave the workflow asserting the old
 * number and reporting a mismatch on a perfectly correct run, or worse, passing a run whose
 * thresholds had quietly shrunk.
 *
 * <p><strong>The second invariant is the non-obvious one.</strong> The workflow passes
 * {@code -e K6_ENV=ci} to select {@code THRESHOLDS_CI}; drop that flag and
 * {@code test/k6/health-check.js} falls back to the local {@code THRESHOLDS} in
 * {@code options.js}, which happens to declare the same number of thresholds. The count check
 * would therefore still pass while the canary silently ran against the stricter local SLO figures
 * on a shared two-vCPU runner. That failure direction is safe -- stricter, not looser -- but it is
 * invisible, and a control whose misconfiguration cannot be seen is the kind this repository keeps
 * turning into a build gate. Asserting the flag is present is what makes it visible.
 *
 * <p><strong>What this test does not do.</strong> It proves the two numbers agree and that the
 * profile flag is present. It does not prove the thresholds are the right thresholds, that
 * {@code health-check.js} really consumes {@code THRESHOLDS_CI} rather than merely being able to
 * (that is JavaScript control flow, not text), or that the workflow step is wired into a job that
 * runs. Those stay reviewer-enforced, the same bound {@code ConditionalOnPropertyHavingValueTest}
 * carries: a declared value is not a sensible one. See EOP-158 and ADR-055.

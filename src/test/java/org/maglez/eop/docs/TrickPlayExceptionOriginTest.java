/**
 * Derives the set of non-constraint exception origins from the adapter and holds ADR-023 to it.
 *
 * <p>It exists because prose lost to arithmetic. The paragraph beside ADR-023's constraint-name
 * translation table states how many exceptions arise with no constraint violated, and it said two,
 * then three, then six before nine. Each wrong count was written carefully and reviewed carefully,
 * which is the argument for deriving the number instead of restating it.
 *
 * <p>How it derives. Every construction of a type the adapter imports from {@code
 * org.maglez.eop.entity} is classified by <em>where</em> it sits. Inside {@code dealFailure}, {@code
 * playFailure}, or any of the four {@code catch (final DataIntegrityViolationException ...)} blocks,
 * a constraint really was violated and a row of the table covers it. Inside {@code assertSeated},
 * the refusal came from a read. Anywhere else it came from a rows-affected count of zero. Both
 * groups are located by cutting regions out of the source rather than by subtracting one group's
 * names from the other's, because subtraction cannot tell a type that belongs to both from one that
 * belongs only to the group being subtracted.
 *
 * <p>Each block of the paragraph must then name exactly its own derived group, and the two groups
 * must be disjoint. Per-group equality does not imply disjointness: a type constructed both inside
 * {@code assertSeated} and at a rows-affected position satisfies both equalities while the headings
 * sum to more than the derived total, so that is asserted separately.
 *
 * <p>The one limitation, measured rather than assumed. Membership is a name appearing in a group
 * block, so if a block mentions a type twice — once enumerating it, once in narrative — deleting
 * only the enumerating mention leaves it detected. A block would have to keep discussing a type it
 * had stopped listing for this to hide anything, and the mutations validating this class therefore
 * remove every mention. Closing it would mean parsing prose intent, which this approach cannot do.
 *
 * <p>It reads the adapter as text because the distinction being derived is positional and reflection
 * cannot see it. A construction moved into a helper called <em>from</em> a translation would be
 * classified wrongly.
 *
 * <p>No account here of which assertion a given mutation trips, and no tally of attack shapes or assertion counts. Earlier
 * versions of this comment gave both, and each was left behind by the next change to the code it
 * described. The assertion messages are the record: they cannot go stale, because they are what
 * fires.

     * <p>A review gate diagnosed the shape of the problem exactly: the paragraph asserts
     * a <em>mapping</em> from name to mechanism, and every check built for it verified
     * <em>aggregates</em> of that mapping. Aggregates over a mapping leave every permutation green by
     * construction, however many you add, which is why strengthening the total, then the padding
     * direction, then the derivation's positional honesty each closed a real hole and left the next
     * one open in the same place.
     *
     * <p>The gate proved it by moving {@code CardNotInHandException} from the rows-affected block into
     * the read block, leaving both headings untouched: the build stayed green. That is not an abstract
     * hole — it is the exact mis-filing the block's own text records as its own past mistake, so the
     * guard built to stop it recurring could not see it recurring.
     *
     * <p>Per-group equality catches an origin the adapter gains and the prose omits, a name the
     * prose invents, a name the prose deletes, and a name that moves between groups. A duplicated
     * heading, and a rewording that leaves no block matching, are caught by {@link #namedInBlock}'s
     * requirement of exactly one match. No total is given here on purpose — a count of attack shapes is one more
     * number to get wrong.

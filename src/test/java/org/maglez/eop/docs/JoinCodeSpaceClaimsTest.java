/**
 * Holds the prose that reasons about the <em>width of the join-code space</em> against the two
 * constants that actually determine it: {@link JoinCode#ALPHABET} and {@link JoinCode#LENGTH}.
 *
 * <p>This test exists because of a fragility named in EOP-56. Two places justify a decision by
 * appeal to how wide the code space is — {@code GlobalExceptionHandler} logs an exhausted
 * join-code budget at {@code WARN} <em>with a stack trace</em> on the grounds that a caller
 * cannot provoke it, and refuses to say why a lookup failed on the grounds that confirming a
 * real code would be an oracle worth querying. Both arguments are sound at forty bits and both
 * quietly stop being sound if the alphabet shrinks or the code gets shorter. Nothing connected
 * the prose to the constants, so such a change would have withdrawn the justification for
 * logging a trace on a caller-reachable path while every test stayed green.
 *
 * <p>EOP-56's remedy was to make the reasoning rest on a <em>control</em> — the per-address
 * creation rate limit from ADR-033 — rather than on arithmetic alone, because a control survives
 * a change to the constants. That is a change to the argument, not to the arithmetic, and the
 * arithmetic is still quoted in both places as the reason an occurrence is worth reading. This
 * test is the other half: it makes the quoted width derived rather than asserted, so shrinking
 * the alphabet or the code turns the stale sentences red instead of leaving them to be believed.
 *
 * <p>The derivation is deliberately narrow. It computes bits per character as the base-2
 * logarithm of the alphabet size, which is only a whole number when that size is a power of two,
 * so the power-of-two check is a precondition of the derivation rather than a style preference.
 * It also requires the alphabet's characters to be distinct, because a repeated character would
 * leave {@code length()} unchanged while lowering the entropy each character actually carries —
 * the one way these constants could drift without either asserted number moving.
 *
 * <p>Coverage comes in two layers, because the two failure modes are different. Three
 * <em>justifications</em> are pinned individually by anchor phrase, so that a failure names the
 * argument that has gone stale and says what it was for. Anchoring is precise but fragile —
 * rewording an anchor would make its check vacuous rather than red — so each anchor is asserted to
 * occur <em>exactly once</em>, which turns a reword into a failure and a duplication into one too.
 *
 * <p>Anchoring alone would still have missed the larger problem. The width is quoted in more than
 * a dozen places: the entity's own Javadoc, both join limiters, the generator and its port, the
 * join use case, an exception, and the C4 and runtime-view documents. EOP-24 widened the code from
 * six characters to eight and every one of those sentences had to be found and corrected by hand.
 * So the second layer is a sweep of {@code src/main/java}, {@code docs/architecture},
 * {@code docs/adr} and {@code docs/api} that requires <em>every</em> spelled-out bit width to be
 * the derived one, which
 * means a site added later is covered without anyone remembering to register it.
 *
 * <p>The sweep needs an escape hatch, because some passages quote a width deliberately in order to
 * argue against it: ADR-019 rejects six characters at thirty bits and ten at fifty, the generator
 * and both architecture documents explain what was wrong with thirty, and ADR-021 quotes the
 * superseded wording verbatim. Those are listed in {@link #SUPERSEDED}, each with its reason, and
 * the list fails in <em>both</em> directions — an unexplained width fails, and so does an entry
 * that no longer matches anything, so a deleted historical passage means deleting its entry rather
 * than leaving it to rot. What the sweep deliberately does not do is check digits or powers of
 * two written out longhand; it reads the English words the prose actually uses.

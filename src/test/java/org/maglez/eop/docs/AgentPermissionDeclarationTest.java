/**
 * Holds ADR-065's role boundaries against the agent definitions themselves, so that an agent can no longer acquire a
 * permission by saying nothing about it.
 *
 * <p>OpenCode's effective ruleset begins with an implicit {@code {"permission":"*","action":"allow","pattern":"*"}}
 * and the last matching rule wins, so <strong>omitting a key affirmatively grants it</strong>. That is not a
 * theoretical hazard: it is exactly how the Product Owner came to write seven Java and XML files under
 * {@code src/} and push them, twice — its frontmatter declared {@code task} and four Jira allows and simply never
 * mentioned {@code edit} or {@code bash}. ADR-065 closed that per agent, and recorded as its own known limitation
 * that nothing in {@code ./mvnw verify} walks {@code .opencode/agents/}, so a newly added agent inherits every
 * permission it does not state. This test is that missing walk.
 *
 * <p><strong>What it proves is narrow, and the bound matters.</strong> It proves a key is <em>declared</em>. It says
 * nothing about whether the value is sensible: {@code bash: {"*": allow}} declares {@code bash} and grants
 * everything. Semantic correctness stays reviewer-enforced, exactly as {@code ConditionalOnPropertyHavingValueTest}
 * is bounded to comparing one attribute rather than judging whether a flag gates the right beans. The point is that
 * an author must make a decision and write it down, where a reviewer can see it and disagree.
 *
 * <p>Three facts are read from the working tree rather than hardcoded: which agents exist, what each declares, and
 * whether a catch-all covers it. The two exception lists are declared explicitly below, each carrying the reason it
 * is accepted, on the {@code SeparationInvariantTest} pattern — declared, justified and self-retiring, so closing an
 * exception means deleting its entry rather than leaving it passing over nothing (ADR-006, ADR-052).
 *
 * <p>Surefire runs with the working directory set to the project base directory, so the relative paths resolve.
 *

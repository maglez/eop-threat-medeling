/**
 * Guards prose about the deck against arithmetic that the deck size has outgrown (EOP-93).
 *
 * <p>The deck has been trimmed twice: EOP-69 took it from 78 cards to 74, and EOP-75 removed the six Aces to leave 68
 * (ADR-041). Each trim left prose behind. EOP-92's review found three documents simultaneously stale with a green
 * build, and EOP-93 then found fifteen more places — five of them in Java javadoc, four of them in claims no reviewer
 * had listed. Nothing in the build noticed any of it, because a comment cannot fail to compile.
 *
 * <p>The recurring defect was never the digits. It was the <em>universal quantifier</em>. Prose kept asserting that
 * the deal is uneven at <em>every</em> supported table size, which was true at 74 cards and false at 68: 68 divides
 * evenly by four, so at that one table size every seat holds seventeen and the final trick is full. Sentences of that
 * shape survived both trims because they name no number at all. Two concrete examples, both live on {@code main}
 * until EOP-93: "At 74 cards, all four supported table sizes (3, 4, 5 and 6 players) produce unequal hands", and
 * "EOP-14 deals the whole deck out, so at every supported player count (3, 4, 5 and 6) the hands are unequal".
 *
 * <p>So the first invariant here does not look for stale numbers. It looks for a universal claim over table sizes
 * sitting in the same sentence as a claim that the deal is uneven, and fails only when some supported table size
 * actually does divide the deck evenly. It is derived from {@link #CURRENT_DECK_SIZE}, so the next trim needs one
 * number changed rather than a re-reading of every document. The second invariant is the cheap one the first cannot
 * express: no superseded deck size stated in Java prose, where javadoc went stale five times in a row.
 *
 * <p>The third invariant was added by EOP-96 for a defect the second structurally cannot see: a number that is not a
 * deck size but is <em>derived</em> from one. Five places priced a per-trick score assembler at the figure a
 * 78-card deck produces, and because 79 is not 78 the figure survived two deck trims and EOP-93's sweep untouched.
 * Both the trick count and the read count are computed here from {@link #CURRENT_DECK_SIZE}, so the next trim again
 * needs one number changed.
 *
 * <p>That invariant is narrow on purpose, and the narrowness is the interesting part. It matches only a round-trip
 * count, only where the line is pricing a read, and never inside a Markdown table row. Each restriction was forced
 * by a real line in this repository: ADR-023 tabulates the 78-card and 74-card deals under EOP-69's Amends header,
 * which is correct history; ADR-011 says "while the 26 descriptions existed ... neither graphify_get_node nor
 * graphify_query_graph rendered them", which any matcher keyed on "query" or on the derived trick count would have
 * flagged. Widening it would trade a defect this repository has had for false positives it has not.
 *
 * <p>The standing caveat applies to all three: these are phrase lists, not semantic analysis. A green build here is
 * not proof that the documentation is right, only that the specific wordings that have gone stale before are absent.
 *
 * <p>Be precise about what "a universal claim" means here, because the phrase flatters the implementation. {@link
 * #EVERY_TABLE_SIZE} is a list of the phrasings that have actually gone stale in this repository, not a semantic
 * analysis of quantification. "At all four table sizes", "at each player count" and "the final trick is always
 * short" all escape it. That is a deliberate trade — a matcher general enough to catch every phrasing of a universal
 * claim would also catch the many true ones — but it has a consequence worth stating plainly: <em>a green build is
 * not proof that no stale universal claim exists.</em> It proves only that the specific shapes which have burned us
 * before are absent. Extend the pattern when a new shape appears; do not read the pass as a clean bill of health.
 *
 * <p>The scope is deliberately narrow, because an over-strict version of this test would be worked around instead of
 * obeyed. It matches per sentence rather than per paragraph, so an unrelated later sentence cannot supply the second
 * half of a contradiction; it says nothing about the many correct historical references in {@code docs/} — the
 * author's own "74, not 78 cards" quote, ADR-041, and the dated amendment blocks all state superseded sizes on
 * purpose; and it does not police ADR-023's original body, which still reads 78 cards under EOP-69's explicit
 * {@code Amends:} header and is correct as it stands.
 *
 * <p>This is a plain JUnit test with no Spring context. Surefire runs with the working directory set to the project
 * base directory, so the relative paths resolve.

/**
 * Holds the three declarations of each shared enum in agreement: the Java entity, the OpenAPI
 * schema, and the TypeScript mirror in {@code ui/src/api.ts} (EOP-105).
 *
 * <p>The same value is declared three times in this repository and nothing but habit kept the
 * three in step. EOP-105 is what that costs. {@code PlayerDto.role} had been typed
 * {@code 'FACILITATOR' | 'PLAYER'} while the server has only ever emitted {@code PARTICIPANT}
 * for a non-facilitator, and {@code SessionStateDto.status} carried an invented {@code 'ENDED'}
 * while omitting both {@code COMPLETED} and {@code ABANDONED}. Neither error could fail at
 * runtime: a TypeScript union is erased at compile time, and every fetch helper in that file
 * ends {@code (await response.json()) as SomeDto} — an assertion, not a parse — so the wrong
 * values arrived unchallenged and every comparison against a real one silently evaluated false.
 * The defect surfaced only because a reviewer read two files side by side.
 *
 * <p>That is the review this class replaces. It is deliberately a Java test rather than a
 * Vitest one: the front end has no {@code @types/node} on purpose, so that a browser project
 * does not pull in Node's type definitions ({@code ui/vite.config.ts} avoids {@code process.env}
 * for the same reason), and a Vitest case therefore cannot read {@code openapi.yml} or a Java
 * source file off disk. Reading repository files as text during {@code verify} is established
 * practice here in any case — see {@code AdrIndexConsistencyTest} (EOP-32),
 * {@code DeckArithmeticClaimsTest} (EOP-93) and {@code TrickPlayExceptionOriginTest} (EOP-14).
 * The Vitest suite keeps the complementary duty it can discharge in the browser: that each
 * declared member is accepted by its type guard and a non-member rejected.
 *
 * <p>Scope is membership, not order. Asserting that all three artefacts list their members in
 * the same sequence would be free to write and would fail the build for a harmless
 * re-alphabetising of a YAML block, which is the kind of strictness that gets a test deleted
 * rather than obeyed. Membership is the whole of the defect class: a value one artefact knows
 * and another does not.
 *
 * <p>This is a plain JUnit test with no Spring context. Surefire runs with the working directory
 * set to the project base directory, so the relative paths resolve.

     *
     * <p>Adding a Java enum that the API exposes and the front end branches on means adding a row
     * here. Nothing detects an omission, which is the hole left in this guard: it keeps the mirrors
     * it is told about honest, and cannot know it has not been told about one. That hole is not
     * hypothetical — when this test was first written it covered three enums while
     * {@code ui/src/api.ts} mirrored a fourth, {@code StrideCategory}, as a bare union whose own
     * comment claimed parity with the server. EOP-105's review caught it and it is registered below.
     *
     * <p>Two enums the contract declares are deliberately absent from the table below:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>{@code Rank} has no mirror in {@code ui/src/api.ts} — no {@code as const} array, no
     *       derived union, no {@code is*} guard — and EOP-109 decided it should stay that way rather
     *       than adding one by default. State it with that scope rather than as "no mirror at all":
     *       a hand-written twelve-member rank list does exist in
     *       {@code ui/src/utils/cardImagePath.test.ts}, and it is invisible to
     *       {@link #typeScriptArrayValues} because that method recognises only the
     *       {@code export const NAME = [...] as const;} idiom. It is test-only, so drifting from the
     *       Java enum would under-test asset coverage rather than corrupt production behaviour, and
     *       it does not change the decision recorded here. Be precise about what that costs: the
     *       contract
     *       {@code $ref}s {@code Rank} for that field, so {@code Card.rank} and
     *       {@code CardDto.rank} being bare {@code string} in {@code ui/src/api.ts} is an accepted
     *       <em>drift</em>, not fidelity. Do not restate it as the contract declaring {@code rank}
     *       as {@code type: string} — it does not; {@code Card.rank} is
     *       {@code $ref: '#/components/schemas/Rank'}. The drift is accepted because the client
     *       never compares or orders a rank: the contract supplies {@code rankValue} expressly for
     *       comparison, the card face is rendered from {@code rankSymbol}, and {@code rank} reaches
     *       exactly one consumer — {@code cardImagePath(suit, rank)}, which returns {@code null}
     *       for anything it does not recognise and whose every call site null-checks. An
     *       out-of-contract rank therefore degrades to a missing image, never to a wrong
     *       comparison. Registering the mirror would also need {@link #openApiEnumValues} taught to
     *       read a YAML flow sequence, since {@code Rank} is written
     *       {@code enum: [TWO, THREE, ...]} on one line rather than as a block — a change to this
     *       gate's own parser, bought for a field with no client-side comparison to protect. If
     *       rank ever becomes something the front end orders or compares, add the mirror and teach
     *       the parser then.
     *   <li>{@code ProblemDetail} and the other response schemas carry no enums.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>A third exclusion used to sit here for a weaker reason, and it is now closed rather than
     * merely re-worded: {@code StrideCategory}-valued fields in {@code ui/src/api.ts} that were
     * declared bare {@code string} even though the mirror they should have used was registered
     * below. EOP-108 narrowed {@code CardDto.suit} and EOP-109 narrowed {@code TrickDto.ledSuit},
     * the last of them, so every field whose contract schema is a <em>mirrored</em> enum is now
     * both typed against that mirror and membership-checked by a parser in {@code ui/src/api.ts}.
     * Read that scope precisely: it is a claim about mirrored enums, and {@code rank} sits outside
     * it because {@code Rank} has no mirror, not because {@code rank} is narrow. Keep it that way:
     * a new bare-{@code string} field whose schema {@code $ref}s a <em>mirrored</em> enum belongs
     * in neither this list nor the code.

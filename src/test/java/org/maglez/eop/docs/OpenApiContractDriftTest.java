/**
 * Fails the build when the application's HTTP surface drifts from the hand-authored contract in
 * {@code docs/api/openapi.yml} (EOP-95, ADR-054).
 *
 * <h2>The defect this replaces</h2>
 *
 * <p>This project is contract-first by rule: {@code .opencode/rules/api-design.md} requires
 * {@code docs/api/openapi.yml} to be hand-authored before an endpoint is implemented, and the file's own
 * header says "when an endpoint changes, this file changes in the same commit". Nothing checked that.
 * EOP-72 changed observable dealing behaviour and left the contract untouched; the divergence survived a
 * whole story with a green build and was found by a manual audit (EOP-83), not by the suite. Three
 * documents were stale at once. The Documentation Gate — a human reading a diff — was the only thing
 * between a stale corpus and {@code main} on two consecutive stories.
 *
 * <h2>What this guard actually compares</h2>
 *
 * <p>It boots the application, turns springdoc on for this context only, reads the document springdoc
 * generates at {@code /v3/api-docs}, and compares it against the authored file on two axes, in both
 * directions:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Operation bijection</b> — the set of {@code METHOD path} pairs. An endpoint Spring serves but
 *       the contract omits fails; so does a path the contract promises but Spring does not serve.</li>
 *   <li><b>Declared response status codes</b> — per operation, the set of status codes. This catches the
 *       common drift of adding a failure mode in code and not documenting it, or removing one and leaving
 *       the promise behind.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Reading the generated document rather than scanning annotations by hand is the point: springdoc
 * builds it from Spring's own {@code RequestMappingHandlerMapping}, so this guard cannot disagree with
 * what the application actually serves. A route registered by a mechanism a text scan would miss is
 * still in the generated document.
 *
 * <h2>What it does not catch — read this before trusting it</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>It would not have caught EOP-72.</b> That defect was prose: the contract described "all 68 cards
 * are dealt" while the code dealt {@code floor(D/n) × n}. Both the path and the status codes were
 * unchanged, so both axes above stay green. Descriptions, examples and narrative are compared by nothing
 * here. This guard closes an adjacent hole — signature and status drift — and the honest statement of its
 * limit is in ADR-054 rather than left implied.
 *
 * <p>It also does not compare request or response <b>schemas</b>. springdoc's generated schemas and the
 * authored ones differ routinely and legitimately on {@code $ref} naming, nullability spelling, examples
 * and description text, so a property-level diff would be noise, and a noisy gate gets deleted rather
 * than obeyed. Schema fidelity remains reviewer-enforced.
 *
 * <p>Nor does it check that a documented status code is <i>reachable</i>, only that code and contract
 * agree that it is declared. Both can be wrong together.
 *
 * <h2>Why there is no allow-list</h2>
 *
 * <p>The comparison covers the whole surface Spring serves, including {@code GET /health}, which is why
 * that endpoint is now documented in the authored file despite sitting outside {@code /api/v1}. An
 * exclusion list is what turns a gate into a formality, so there is none.
 *
 * <p>There is one declared exception, and it is <b>required rather than permitted</b>: {@code 413} on
 * {@code POST /api/v1/sessions} is produced by Caddy, not by Spring, so no truthful {@code @ApiResponse}
 * can exist for it and springdoc can never emit it. {@link #shouldNotCarryAnUnnecessaryException()} fails
 * if that entry ever stops being needed — either because the authored file dropped the status or because
 * the application started producing it — so the exception cannot quietly outlive its reason. This is the
 * same fail-in-both-directions discipline as {@code tools/supply-chain/accepted-advisories.json}, and it
 * is different in kind from an opt-out list: an entry here is a claim that must keep being true.
 *
 * <h2>Notes for whoever maintains this</h2>
 *
 * <p>Unlike its five siblings in this package, this guard boots a Spring context — it has to, because the
 * generated document only exists at runtime. The {@code properties} array below is byte-identical to
 * {@code SpringdocOptInIntegrationTest}'s, including order, so Spring's context cache key matches and the
 * context is shared rather than booted a second time. If the two ever diverge this still works; it just
 * costs a boot.
 *
 * <p>The authored file is parsed by indentation rather than with a YAML library, matching
 * {@link EnumMirrorParityTest}. That is deliberate: it means inconsistent indentation or an unquoted
 * status key fails here too, instead of being silently normalised by a parser and drifting from the
 * formatting every other operation in the file uses. The parse is bounded to the {@code paths:} block so
 * that three-digit keys elsewhere in the document cannot be mistaken for status codes.
 *
 * <p>No minimum-operation floor is asserted, because one would be redundant: a parse that silently
 * matched nothing would fail {@link #shouldDocumentEveryOperationSpringServes()} with every operation the
 * application serves reported as undocumented, which is a louder failure than any floor. Note it is that
 * test and not {@link #shouldServeEveryDocumentedOperation()} which fires, because an empty authored set
 * makes the authored-minus-generated difference empty and so leaves the latter green — the two directions
 * are not interchangeable, and only the generated side is independently guarded, by the status-code
 * assertion on the fetch in {@code readGenerated()}.

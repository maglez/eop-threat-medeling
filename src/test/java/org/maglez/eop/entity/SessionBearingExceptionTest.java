/**
 * Covers the identifier accessors on the exception types that carry one.
 *
 * <p>These accessors had no test at all. A quality gate measured the four session-bearing
 * types at 75% instruction coverage and showed the gap was exactly the accessor body, so a
 * mutation replacing {@code return sessionId} with {@code return null} survived the whole
 * suite. That mutation is not cosmetic. The accessor is the only way a caller recovers the
 * identifier from a caught exception, and the {@code GlobalExceptionHandler} builds its
 * problem details from accessors rather than from {@code getMessage()} precisely so it can
 * choose which identifiers to disclose. An accessor returning null would put a literal
 * "null" in a response body, or throw inside the handler and turn a mapped 404 or 409 into
 * a 500.
 *
 * <p>These are innermost-layer types with no framework imports, so this test needs no
 * Spring context and runs in microseconds.

     * {@link PlayerNotRecognisedException} takes only a session identifier, so it *cannot*

     * puts it in its message, and the handler returns that message verbatim, so the player
     * identifier reaches the response body. That is deliberate — the caller is the player in
     * question, so it is their own identifier being handed back and no third party learns
     * anything — but it is the sort of deliberate choice that should fail a test if someone
     * changes it by accident, in either direction.

/**
 * Builds cards and decks for tests.
 *
 * <p>Not a builder in the {@link CardBuilder} sense: it does not vary one field of one card, it produces
 * the specific cards a trick-taking rule needs to be tested against. A follow-suit test needs a hand
 * that holds the led suit and one that does not; a deal test needs all seventy-four cards.
 *
 * <p>Card identifiers are derived from the suit and rank rather than random, so the same card is always
 * the same identifier across a test. That matters because {@link Hand#holds(Card)} compares by
 * identifier: a fixture that minted a fresh identifier each call would make a hand fail to recognise
 * its own card, and the test would fail for a reason that has nothing to do with the rule under test.
 *
 * <p>Exists only in the test tree. Production code never constructs a card, because cards come from a
 * migration.

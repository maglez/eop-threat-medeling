/**
 * Test data builder for {@link Trick}.
 *
 * <p>Builds through {@link Trick#reconstitute} rather than through
 * {@link Trick#open} followed by a run of {@link Trick#play} calls, so a test can
 * state a mid-trick or a resolved trick directly instead of replaying the moves
 * that would have produced it. The constructor invariants still run, so a builder
 * cannot assemble a trick the domain would refuse.
 *
 * <p>Because {@code Trick} requires the first play to belong to the leading seat,
 * {@link #withPlays} does not silently reorder anything: a test that states an
 * impossible ordering gets the exception, which is usually the point.

/**
 * A trick repository that keeps one session's current trick in memory.
 *
 * <p>Hand written for the same reason as {@link InMemoryHandRepository}, and
 * with the same deliberate omission: the compare-and-set on the recorded leader
 * seat that every write on this port carries is not reproduced here. Whether a
 * conditional update matches a row is a question only a database can answer, so
 * it is settled in the adapter's integration tests. What a use case test can
 * settle is which witness the use case passed down — and passing the wrong one,
 * or passing one taken from a request body, is the defect this double is shaped
 * to expose.
 *
 * <p>Each write records its arguments and appends its name to the shared call
 * log, so a test can assert both that a trick was opened before a play was
 * appended and that no trick was opened at all when the play was refused.

/**
 * Tests for the command that carries a play in from the edge of the application.
 *
 * <p>This record is a security boundary rather than a convenience, so the assertions worth making
 * are about what it refuses and what it normalises. Two of them are about fields that are not here
 * at all: there is no seat and no player identifier, because both are derived from the identity
 * token, and no suit and no rank, because both are read from the deck. Those omissions cannot be
 * asserted directly — a test cannot check that a component is absent — so they are held by the
 * compiler instead, and what is left to test is the handling of the components that do exist.
 *
 * <p>The component list is the interesting one. A play that links no threat is an ordinary
 * outcome rather than an error, so an absent list has to mean "none" and not "invalid", and the
 * list has to be copied on the way in because a trick play rejects a null element and a caller
 * who kept a reference could otherwise add one after the command was built.

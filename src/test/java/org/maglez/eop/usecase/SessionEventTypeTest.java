/**
 * The wire names carried by session events.
 *
 * <p>These strings are part of the published contract: a browser subscribes to
 * {@code player-joined} by that exact name, so renaming the constant must not
 * silently rename the event. Pinning them here makes that rename a build failure
 * rather than a front end that stops reacting.
 *
 * <p>Three of the five names are reserved rather than published. Nothing emits
 * {@code hand-dealt}, {@code card-played} or {@code trick-resolved} yet, because
 * wiring the publisher into the trick play use cases is a later slice. They are
 * minted here and in {@code openapi.yml} together, ahead of the code that will
 * emit them, because the name is the part clients depend on: a client may match
 * on a reserved name today and keep working unchanged when the server starts
 * sending it. A later release may begin emitting a reserved name; it may never
 * rename one. The test below reads the contract to make sure the two lists cannot
 * drift apart, which is the failure this pairing exists to prevent.

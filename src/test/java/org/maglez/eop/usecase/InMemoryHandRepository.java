/**
 * A hand repository that keeps one session's deal in memory.
 *
 * <p>Hand written rather than mocked, for the reason
 * {@link InMemoryCardRepository} gives: the use cases above this port are thin,
 * so what is worth asserting is which arguments they pass down and which answer
 * they make of what comes back, and a real object reads better than a script of
 * expectations that mostly restates the implementation.
 *
 * <p>It deliberately does <em>not</em> reproduce the adapter's conditional
 * writes. {@link HandRepository#recordDeal} refuses a second deal by writing the
 * opening leader seat only where none is recorded, and that behaviour belongs to
 * the adapter and its integration tests, where a real database can arbitrate
 * between two callers. Reimplementing it here would only assert that this class
 * agrees with itself, and would quietly become the thing under test.
 *
 * <p>Every write appends its name to the shared call log so a test can pin the
 * order of calls across collaborators — the one property a use case can get
 * wrong without any single collaborator noticing.

 * Identifier generator that hands out a prepared queue.

 * <p>A queue rather than a single value, because {@link CreateSessionUseCase} draws
 * one identifier for the player and then another for every session it attempts. A
 * fake returning a constant would hide that, and a test asserting the player kept
 * its identity across a retry would pass for the wrong reason.
 *
 * <p>Running the queue dry throws rather than returning a random identifier: an
 * exhausted queue means the use case made more calls than the test expected, which
 * is a finding, not something to paper over.

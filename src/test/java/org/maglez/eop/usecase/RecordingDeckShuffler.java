/**
 * A {@link DeckShuffler} that reverses the deck instead of randomising it.
 *
 * <p>Reversal is chosen deliberately over the identity permutation. A shuffler that handed the deck
 * straight back would let a use case that forgot to shuffle at all pass every assertion, because the
 * dealt order would match the canonical one either way. Reversal is a permutation of the whole deck
 * that no accident produces, so a test can state exactly which order was dealt and know the shuffle
 * was the thing that produced it.
 *
 * <p>Randomness is what the production implementation is for, and it is the one property a
 * deterministic test cannot assert. That split is why {@link DeckShuffler} is a port at all: the
 * distribution is measured once, against the real generator, and every use-case test above it gets a
 * permutation it can predict.

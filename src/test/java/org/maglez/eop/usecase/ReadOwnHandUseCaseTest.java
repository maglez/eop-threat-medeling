/**
 * Exercises the one read that returns cards to the player holding them.
 *
 * <p>The assertion that earns its keep is that every seat gets its own hand and nobody else's. A
 * test that only ever read as seat zero would pass against a use case that ignored the token and
 * returned the leader's hand, or the first hand in the map, and the defect would be the worst kind
 * this game can have: a player seeing another player's cards. So the happy path is asserted once per
 * seat, and each assertion names the card that seat and only that seat was dealt.
 *
 * <p>Two refusals are asserted to happen <em>before</em> any hand is read, by checking that the
 * repository was never asked. The order matters because {@link HandRepository} authorises nobody
 * (ADR-024): if this use case read first and authorised second, the hands would already be in memory
 * at the moment of the refusal, and the next careless edit would return them.
 *
 * <p>Two states that look like faults are asserted to be ordinary answers instead — a hand emptied by
 * play, and a session that has finished. Both are deliberate, and without a test the obvious
 * "tidying" is to add a status check that hides a player's own cards from them.
 *
 * <p>The deck is a single suit and one card per seat, so the card a seat was dealt identifies the
 * hand it came from without the test having to restate any rule about ranks or trumps.

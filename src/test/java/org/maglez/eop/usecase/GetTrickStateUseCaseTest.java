/**
 * Exercises the only read that answers whose turn it is.
 *
 * <p>Every assertion here is about a moment, because the four answers this use case gives change
 * shape at each of them and nothing else in the system reports them. A test that only read a trick
 * under way would pass against an implementation that never consulted the seats holding cards, and
 * the table would then be told to wait for a card from a player who has none.
 *
 * <p>Five moments are pinned: after the deal but before the first lead, with a trick part played,
 * with a trick complete and waiting to be resolved, with a trick resolved and play continuing, and
 * with the hand played out. The interesting one is the last, because {@code seatToPlay} and
 * {@code handComplete} together are the only way a client can tell "nobody may play because the
 * trick is finished" from "nobody may play because the hand is finished", and an implementation
 * that reported the winner's seat in both cases would look correct in every other test.
 *
 * <p>{@code seatToPlay} and {@code nextLeaderSeat} come from different authorities on purpose — the
 * cards in the trick and the seat the session records as leading — so where both are present they
 * are asserted to agree rather than one being derived from the other. Reconciling them in the use
 * case would throw away the only check a client has on either.
 *
 * <p>The refusals are asserted to happen <em>before</em> any hand is read, by checking the
 * repository was never asked. {@link HandRepository} authorises nobody (ADR-024), so if this use
 * case read first and authorised second the whole table's hands would be in memory at the moment a
 * stranger was turned away.
 *
 * <p>The deck is a single suit throughout, so the highest rank played takes the trick without the
 * test having to restate any rule about trumps.

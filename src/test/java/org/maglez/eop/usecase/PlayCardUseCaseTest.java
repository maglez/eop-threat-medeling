/**
 * Exercises {@link PlayCardUseCase} against hand written doubles for both trick play ports.
 *
 * <p>Four groups of assertion earn their keep here. The first is that a refusal writes nothing,
 * and in particular that it opens no trick: this use case is the one place that opens a trick, it
 * does so before the play is accepted, and an open trick with no plays in it is a state no caller
 * asked for and no later slice knows how to clear. That is why every refusal test asserts on
 * {@code opened()} being empty rather than only on the exception type.
 *
 * <p>The second is that the compare-and-set witness handed to both writes is the leader seat this
 * use case <em>read</em>, never a value derived from the command. The command cannot carry one, so
 * the assertion is really about the use case not inventing one; passing the acting seat instead
 * would let a follower's write masquerade as the leader's (ADR-020).
 *
 * <p>The third is that the play which reaches the port carries the card <em>as dealt</em>. The
 * command names only an identifier, the deck supplies suit and rank, and the hand confirms
 * possession; a play persisted from the command rather than from
 * {@link Trick#acceptPlay(int, TrickPlay, Hands)} would be the card forgery defect returning.
 *
 * <p>The fourth is that the announcement follows the write and carries none of the play. A
 * subscriber prompted to re-read the table before the play was stored would read the table it
 * already had and would get no second prompt, so the shared interaction log is asserted rather
 * than only the event; and a refused play announces nothing at all, because a client that re-reads
 * on every notification would otherwise be sent looking for a change that never happened.
 *
 * <p>The opening leader is derived from the deal rather than written down, because which seat holds
 * the lowest Tampering card is a property of the deck and the seat count, and a hard coded seat
 * would silently stop meaning anything if either changed.

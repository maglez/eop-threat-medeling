# ADR-024: One Adapter Implements Both Trick-Play Ports, and Neither Port Authorises Anybody

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-08-13
**Deciders:** @architecture-guardian, @security-auditor, @tech-lead

## Context

EOP-14 Slice C1 adds storage for dealt hands and played tricks. It is reached through two ports,
`HandRepository` and `TrickRepository`, split that way because dealing and playing are separate
operations with separate callers arriving in Slice C2: `DealHandsUseCase` has no business holding a
method that appends a play, and `PlayCardUseCase` has none holding a method that deals.

Playing a card, however, is not separable in *storage*. One play deletes a row from `hand_card`,
inserts a row into `trick_play`, and inserts one row per component into `trick_play_component`.
Those writes must succeed or fail together. If they do not, a card leaves a hand with no play
recorded — a card that is gone from the game, in a game where every card is dealt and the deal is
the only source of cards (ADR-023, decision 1). There is no compensating action available, because
nothing in the schema records that the card was ever held.

Separately, and this is the reason this ADR exists rather than a comment: gate 3 of Slice C1's
definition-of-done rejected the slice twice for documentation that claimed an authorisation the
layer does not perform. The claim was that because every write begins with a conditional update on
the session row, a caller with no business in the session is refused before any row confirming the
session exists is read. That is false — the conditional statements carry no player identifier — and
it took two remediation rounds to remove it from the adapter's javadoc, the two ports and
`CHANGELOG.md`. The underlying fact needs a home a Slice C2 author will actually find, because
ADR-023's obligation 1 assigns the requester check to the use case while the adapter now throws two
exceptions that look exactly like it.

## Decision

### 1. One class implements both ports

`TrickPlayRepositoryAdapter` implements `HandRepository` and `TrickRepository`. The alternative
decompositions are both worse, and it is worth naming why, because "one adapter per port" is what a
first reading of Clean Architecture pushes toward:

- **Two adapters, two transactions.** This admits the torn state above as a possible outcome. It is
  not a trade-off; it is the defect.
- **Two adapters, one transaction declared above them.** The only place left to declare that
  transaction is the use-case package, which would put `org.springframework.transaction` on the
  inward side of the dependency rule. `.opencode/rules/clean-architecture.md` forbids it, and
  rightly: the use case would then be unable to state its own logic without stating Spring's.

The ports stay separate because the *callers* are separate. Only the implementation is shared.
Interface segregation is a property of the interfaces, not of the number of classes behind them.

Exactly two responsibilities live in that class and nowhere else. The first is the transaction
boundary. The second is translating a constraint violation into a domain exception, so that Spring
Data types, JPA entities and `DataIntegrityViolationException` all stop there and what continues
inwards is something the domain and the web layer already understand.

Placing the transaction boundary inside the adapter has a second effect that was not the reason for
the decision but is now a reason to keep it: ADR-023's lock-ordering policy is a statement about the
order of statements *within one transaction*. Composed in the use case from two adapters, that
policy would become a convention spread across three files. Composed here, it is a property of one
method that a reader can check by reading it.

### 2. Neither port authorises anybody, and no implementation of them can

This is the decision most likely to be misread, so it is stated flatly. **No method on either port
takes an acting player.** It follows that no statement either port issues can refuse a caller on
the grounds of *who is asking*. Every refusal these ports make is on the grounds of what the
session's *state* is.

What the adapter does check, method by method:

- `recordDeal` and `appendPlay` assert that the player a row names holds the seat that row claims.
  That is a check on the **row**, not on the **requester**. It happens to throw
  `NotYourSeatException` (403) and `PlayerNotInSessionException` (404), which is exactly what makes
  it mistakable for authorisation.
- `openTrick` and `recordResolution` assert nothing of the kind. Half the write surface has no
  membership check at all, and no foreign key can supply one, because `trick` has no player column
  and `recordResolution` writes only `trick.winner_play_id`.
- `findBySessionId`, `findCurrentLeaderSeat` and `findCurrentTrick` cannot make such a check. There
  is no parameter to check against. For the reads, authorisation here is not merely absent but
  impossible.

`expectedLeaderSeat` is not a substitute. It is a compare-and-set witness, and a stranger who
guesses it correctly passes it — a one-in-six shot in a six-seat game.

**Authorising the requester is the use case's obligation, and it must be discharged before any port
method is called.** ADR-023's obligation 1 owns the requirement; this ADR records that the layer
below it does not and cannot help.

### 3. Reads revalidate through domain factories rather than trusting rows

Every read path funnels its rows through a domain factory that re-runs the invariants, rather than
returning what the database happened to hold:

- `Hands.reconstitute` for a session's hands, which re-runs four cross-seat invariants.
- `Trick.reconstitute` for a trick, whose constructor bounds the leader seat.
- `TrickPlay`'s record constructor for each play.
- `seatRead` for the bare `current_leader_seat` column, which has no factory of its own.
- `winnerAmong` for a recorded winner, which refuses a `winner_play_id` that is not among the
  trick's own plays.

The last of those is not defensive programming for its own sake. Slice B *measured*
`fk_trick_winner_play` accepting a play from a different trick and even from a different session.
A winner silently dropped would reconstitute the trick as unresolved and admit a second resolution
with a different outcome.

## Consequences

**Negative — the class is the largest in the repository and will grow.** At roughly 745 lines it is
held together by the transaction boundary and by nothing else. The standing instruction that follows
is: **a new aggregate gets a new adapter.** Only writes that must commit together with an existing
one belong here. Convenience, shared collaborators and topical similarity are not reasons.

**Negative, and load-bearing for Slice C2 — undischarged, the failure paths are an oracle.** When a
conditional update matches no rows, `sessionMoved` re-reads the session and answers with one of five
distinguishable exceptions. To a caller who has only *guessed* a session identifier, those five
answers reveal that the session exists, what status it is in, whether hands have been dealt, whether
they have *not* yet been dealt, and which seat currently leads. Every one of those is the right answer
to give a member and the wrong answer to give a stranger, and only the layer above can tell the two
apart. Slice C2's review must
confirm that each of `DealHandsUseCase`, `PlayCardUseCase` and `ResolveTrickUseCase` authorises the
requester and does so *first*. Two facts make this worth a review item rather than a note: the ports
cannot enforce it, and **no test in Slice C1 fails for its absence**. The build stays green either
way, which is precisely why the obligation is recorded in the decision log rather than left in the
javadoc of the class it constrains.

**Negative — one exception ships with no thrower.** `WinningPlayNotInTrickException` is declared and
mapped to 422 but nothing in production raises it. It is Slice C2's `ResolveTrickUseCase` contract
arriving early with the rest of the error vocabulary. Per ADR-023's obligation 3 it will never have
a storage backstop, so the use-case check is the only check that will ever exist. The adapter's own
detection of a corrupt `winner_play_id` deliberately does *not* use it: that is our data being
wrong, and a 422 would tell a caller their well-formed request was unprocessable.

> **Amended 2026-08-13, EOP-14 Slice C2 — the thrower now exists.** `ResolveTrickUseCase.java:131-135`
> raises `WinningPlayNotInTrickException` (the `throw` itself is `:134`) when the resolved winning play
> is not among the plays of the

> narrower — the composite key that would confine it to *this* trick cannot be expressed in Liquibase,
> and ADR-023's obligation 3 records that it never will be. So this is a guard against our own future

> the trick and its plays.

**Neutral — the read side is whole-or-nothing by design.** `Hands.reconstitute` re-runs the
invariant that one card cannot sit in two hands of the same session, and **no database constraint
stands behind it**: `pk_hand_card` stops a duplicate only within one hand, and
`uq_trick_play_trick_card` stops only a double play into one trick. A per-seat read would satisfy
the invariant vacuously and thereby switch off its only enforcement, so `findBySessionId` returns
the whole session's hands or nothing. The write side stays a one-seat delta, because removing a card
from a hand cannot create a duplicate.

**Neutral — the seat foreign keys are a backstop and not a redundant second layer.** Both
`fk_hand_player_seat` and `fk_trick_play_player_seat` bind `(player_id, seat_order)` to
`player (id, seat_order)`, and neither binds that player row to the *hand's* session. A hand naming
a player from a different session, at a seat that player legitimately holds there, satisfies both
keys. The adapter's session-scoped seat map is the only thing that refuses it. Defence in depth is
real here but asymmetric, and the two layers must not be described as equivalent.

**Positive — constraint translation is proved against the real indexes, which is the only way it
can be proved.** The adapter matches on constraint *name*, because every unique, foreign-key and
check violation arrives as the same Spring type. A stubbed test therefore proves only that the
adapter can read a string it was handed. A constraint renamed by a later migration would pass such a
test and answer 500 in production. `TrickPlayRepositoryAdapterIntegrationTest` drives each violation
against a live schema, which is why the translation is trustworthy and why that test is not
substitutable by unit tests.

#
# Supply-chain audit for the OpenCode plugin roster.
#
# Why this exists: SETUP.md used to carry a prose instruction to re-run `npm audit`
# "whenever a pin moves". Over four pin movements it was honoured once, and only
# because a human asked -- one of those movements was a commit that edited the very
# paragraph recording the trigger as unhonoured, without honouring it. Prose does not
# run. This script does.
#
# What it checks, in order of how much it would actually tell you:
#   1. Roster drift    -- every spec in opencode.json has a baseline entry, and vice
#                         versa. Without this, a newly added plugin would skip every
#                         check below and the audit would pass while covering less.
#   2. Maintainers     -- an npm account handoff is the loudest single compromise
#                         signal there is; it preceded most well-known takeovers.
#   3. Provenance      -- whether the pinned version carries an SLSA attestation.
#                         Absence is tolerated (half the roster lacks it); CHANGE is
#                         not, in either direction, because the pins are exact and a
#                         published version's attestation is immutable.
#   4. Advisories      -- every high/critical `npm audit` finding must either be new
#                         (fail) or carry a reachability trace in
#                         tools/supply-chain/accepted-advisories.json. An allowlisted
#                         advisory that is no longer reported ALSO fails, so the list
#                         cannot outlive what it suppresses. Low and moderate findings
#                         are printed and not gated. Plus registry signature
#                         verification over the whole transitive tree.
#
# What it does NOT check, and must never be described as checking: whether a release
# has been backdoored. Advisories answer "is there a published CVE", signatures answer
# "did this tarball come from the registry unmodified", provenance answers "was it
# built by the named repository's CI". None of them answers "is the code benign", and
# that is the failure mode that matters for plugins running unsandboxed inside
# OpenCode with sight of every message and file.
#
# Usage:  tools/supply-chain/audit-plugins.sh
# Exit:   0 = clean, 1 = drift or a high/critical advisory, 2 = could not run.

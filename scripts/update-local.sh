#!/usr/bin/env bash
# =============================================================================
# update-local.sh — rebuild both local Docker images and restart the app stack
# =============================================================================
#
# WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS
# ----------------------
# CI builds and publishes images to GHCR on every push to `main`, but the
# local compose.app.yml defaults to `eop-threat-medeling:local` and
# `eop-ui:local` — tags that are only updated when a developer manually runs
# `docker build`.  There is no mechanism that keeps those local tags in sync
# with `main`.
#
# This gap caused a real incident (EOP-76): the running stack was built on
# Aug 17 07:25 (commit 9a90efd, EOP-68), while the database had all subsequent
# Liquibase migrations applied (including EOP-75's 68-card deck).  The app code
# expected 78 cards; the database held 68.  The deal failed silently,
# `current_leader_seat` was never written, `seatToPlay` came back `undefined`,
# and the opening player's drag was blocked by `isMyTurn = false` — the card
# snapped back with no error shown.
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES
# ---------------------
# 1. Rebuilds `eop-threat-medeling:local` from the current working tree
#    (the backend Dockerfile at the repo root).
# 2. Rebuilds `eop-ui:local` from the current working tree
#    (the frontend Dockerfile under ui/).
# 3. Restarts `eop-app` and `eop-caddy` with --force-recreate so they pick up
#    the new images.
# 4. Leaves `eop-postgres` untouched — data is preserved.
#
# IMPORTANT: this script rebuilds from the CURRENT WORKING TREE, not from
# GHCR.  Run `git pull` first to ensure you are building from the latest main.
#
# OBSOLESCENCE
# ------------
# This script is a temporary convenience.  Once the project is wired up to AWS
# (Terraform + CD pipeline), every merge to `main` will deploy automatically
# and the local stack will no longer be the primary test target.  At that point
# this script can be deleted.
#
# USAGE
#   ./scripts/update-local.sh
#
# PREREQUISITES
# - Docker daemon running (e.g. `colima start`)
# - compose.app.yml stack already up (`docker compose -f compose.app.yml up -d`)

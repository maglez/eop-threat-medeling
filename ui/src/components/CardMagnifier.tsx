/**
 * Card magnifier — a circular CSS lens that follows the pointer over a card and
 * scales the pixels beneath it (EOP-145).
 *
 * The lens is a *pixel* magnifier, not a re-render: it clips a scaled replica of
 * the card's own body to a circle. That is a deliberate limitation and worth
 * stating plainly, because it bounds what this feature can achieve — a card's
 * `threatPrompt` never reaches the visible DOM (it exists only in the card's
 * `aria-label`), so magnifying the card enlarges its art and rank glyphs but
 * does not surface threat text to a sighted player. If reading the scenario text
 * is the real requirement, that is a different story: render the prompt, then
 * magnify it.
 *
 * Accessibility: the lens is decoration over content that is already in the
 * accessibility tree via the card's `aria-label`, so it is `aria-hidden="true"`,
 * takes no focus, and sets `pointer-events: none` so it can never intercept the
 * click or drag that plays a card. Nothing about the keyboard path changes.
